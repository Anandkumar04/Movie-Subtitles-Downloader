# Subtitle Downloader

Subtitle Downloader is a Java command-line tool that automatically searches for and downloads subtitles for movies using the [OpenSubtitles.org API](https://opensubtitles.org/).

## Why was it created?

Manually searching for and downloading subtitles for each movie is time-consuming and repetitive. This tool automates the process, saving users time and effort.

## How does it work?

- The user provides a movie name (or a folder containing movies).
- The tool queries the OpenSubtitles.org API for matching subtitles.
- It downloads the best-matching subtitle file and saves it in the same directory as the movie (or the current directory).
- The tool supports different languages (default is English).

## Key Features

- ðŸš€ **Fully automated** subtitle search and download.
- ðŸŽ¬ Works for **single movies or entire folders** of movies.
- ðŸ”‘ Uses the **official OpenSubtitles API** (requires a free API key).
- â˜• Written in **Java**, easy to run on any system with Java installed.
