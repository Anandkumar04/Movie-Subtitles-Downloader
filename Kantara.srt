1
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:17,500
There once lived a king,
whose mighty empire spanned

2
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:19,875
from Moodanagudda and lasted
till the Paduvana sea.

3
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:23,958
A caring wife and children
to call as his own.

4
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:27,375
Loyal subjects to whom
their king meant everything.

5
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:29,541
A royal figure who was
friendly with one and all.

6
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:33,333
He had everything,
except for peace of mind.

7
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,583
He visited numerous temples and
took a dip in many holy ponds.

8
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:41,375
Despite performing various religious
rituals and worshipping his ancestors,

9
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:45,166
Sound sleep and peace
of mind evaded the King.

10
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:46,291
But why?

11
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:48,375
With that very question in
mind, the king consulted

12
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,333
a soothsayer seeking
answers to his predicament.

13
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,333
O' King, you possess everything.

14
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,375
However, until you find a source of strength
that will guide you like a wise uncle

15
00:01:56,416 --> 00:02:00,291
unconditionally love you like a
mother, you shall not attain peace.

16
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,250
Where would I find it, Sir?

17
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,291
Go in search of it.

18
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:04,333
All alone.

19
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:07,875
The king then set off.

20
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:13,000
He visits various pilgrimage centres,
meets all kinds of spiritual guides.

21
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:17,125
But no matter where he went,
the pain in his heart found no solace.

22
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:25,208
Assuming that there was no place or power that could
give him peace, the King went to the forests.

23
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:31,125
Right in the middle of the woods,
he heard the distant sound of an anklet.

24
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,125
The king halted right there.

25
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,333
But surprisingly,
the sound doesn't frighten the King.

26
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:41,291
It reminded him of a mother’s
love and an uncle’s affection.

27
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:44,333
The king then moved in the
direction of the sound.

28
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:49,583
He is guided towards a stone, in front
of which, he surrenders his weapon.

29
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:56,291
Without the King's knowledge, his eyes teared
up and his hands joined together in reverence.

30
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:57,875
The king felt joy.

31
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,833
Infinite joy that had
evaded him all this while.

32
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,625
Like a mother hugged him.

33
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,291
Like an uncle caressed his head.

34
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Right then...

35
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,875
I bow down as your king.

36
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,375
Please bestow this
Demigod to me.

37
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,125
I’m ready to give
you anything for it.

38
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,083
My dear King!

39
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:26,291
Ask us for anything,
but not our Demigod Panjurli.

40
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:46,791
So, you want me,
the Panjurli Demigod, huh?

41
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,791
I want nothing but you, Panjurli.

42
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,500
I shall come along with you.

43
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,458
But I belong to this village.

44
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:57,708
If I bestow you with happiness, peace and
prosperity, what will you give my people?

45
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,750
Whatever you ask for.

46
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:10,916
You will grant all of the land, across
which the sound of my voice traversed.

47
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:16,916
Remember, I'll be accompanied by my
Compatriot spirit, the ferocious Guliga.

48
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:23,250
Should you err, even if I forgive
you, Kshetrapala Guliga won't.

49
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,333
You have my word, Panjurli.

50
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,625
The palace is decorated and
the village is spruced up.

51
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,458
The King welcomed the Demigod with
inexplicable joy into his kingdom.

52
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:47,875
Since then, the King's life saw no
dearth in harmony, joy and peace.

53
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,333
The villagers' Demigod was
now in the lap of the King.

54
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,875
The King’s vast land was now
in the hands of the villagers.

55
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,000
From then on, the holy procession
commenced from the King’s palace.

56
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,625
Then why is the current Landlord
asking us to return this land?

57
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,208
After all this is their
land, son!

58
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,291
There is nothing wrong if
they ask us to return it.

59
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,541
But we're here to serve the
Demigods, aren't we?

60
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,208
Where can we go
forsaking our Gods?

61
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,583
Son, do you know where
we humans go wrong?

62
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,625
We assume that we own
everything around us.

63
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,916
But forget the reality of
the true owner of it all.

64
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,291
Once we become aware of the
truth, we can live peacefully.

65
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,541
I didn't come all the way from Bombay
to watch Bhootha Kola [SPIRIT WORSHIP].

66
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,375
I need to settle this
land issue on priority.

67
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,000
Do you even hear yourself?

68
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:46,458
This land was donated by our
ancestors to serve the Demigod.

69
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,958
Since then, our family has
been living peacefully.

70
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,083
That's enough!

71
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:51,916
Wasn't it given as charity back then?

72
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,708
Do you have the slightest
idea about its current value?

73
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,833
If we take it back now,
we can lead a life with dignity.

74
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,125
It doesn't work that way.

75
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:02,625
Asking for the land back would mean going
back on the word given to the Demigod.

76
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,625
You and your Demigod
can take a hike!

77
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,833
I'm sick of hearing
this all the time.

78
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:10,375
The performance you'll see is something
I've witnessed many times before.

79
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,541
This is our ancestral property.

80
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,000
I have as much right
over it as you do.

81
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,250
If you can't ask for it,
then take a step back,

82
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,583
I'll handle this in court.

83
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:51,041
I present you the sacred offering
and invite you to wear the gaggara.

84
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:56,375
I humbly accept your invite and seek the
permission of audiences to wear gaggara.

It's the twilight hour, O' Landlord!

98
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,375
It's a practice to address
your questions in my court.

99
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,458
Do you have any
questions, Landlord?

100
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,500
Panjurli?
- Yes!

101
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,625
As of now, I have no questions.

102
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:01,666
I do.

103
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,791
What?!

104
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,625
This place, this
property, this land.

105
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,291
None of these belong
to the villagers.

106
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,625
Quiet. Don't talk, please.
- Fine! It's not yours either.

107
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:12,750
It's mine.

108
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,250
You have to ensure
it's returned to me.

109
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,708
That's a great question, Landlord!

110
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,250
I'll ensure it's
returned to you.

111
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,416
I'll ensure the villagers'
land is returned to you!

112
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:29,541
But can you return the peace I have
blessed you with all these years?

113
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:32,375
Listen!
Won't you be able to get it back for me?

114
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,958
No problem.
I know where to get my job done.

115
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,750
So, you will go to the Court, eh?

116
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:44,208
But I shall pronounce your
judgment on those very stairs.

117
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,375
The land belongs
to the villagers.

118
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,583
That decision will
not be made today.

119
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,583
A day will come in
the distant future.

120
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:51,916
It belongs to the villagers?

121
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:55,833
Is this the Demigod speaking?
Or is it the performer?

122
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,375
Is it the Demigod or the performer?
Let it be decided today.

123
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,958
If it indeed is the performer,
may you find me again.

124
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,625

Did he really disappear?

128
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:06,875
Of course he did.

129
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,708
Wouldn't he have
returned otherwise?

130
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,000
What if he was killed?

131
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,708
If so,
wouldn't we have found his body?

132
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:12,958
That's right.

133
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,250
Do you want to see the
place where he went missing?

134
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:18,125
In the forest, a fire was ablaze
across the place he went missing in.

135
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:22,041
But the fire didn't illuminate the forest,
instead it pushed it into further darkness.

136
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,458
What about the Landlord?

137
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,291
He died vomiting blood on
the stairs of the court.

138
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,000
An extremely powerful Demigod.
- Of course.

139
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:31,375
But I shall pronounce your
judgment on those very stairs.

140
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:45,125
What a powerful Demigod!
- Of course.

141
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,875
Even today, the Demigod protects this
forest, the village and its people.

142
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,708
So damn powerful!

Hello, Mr Sudhakar Shetty!
- Go on, Mr Rajiv Shetty!

170
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,541
Shall we call the buffaloes into the arena?
- Definitely.

171
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,625
Will the Kola continue?
- Why won't it?

172
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,083
So, who's performing?

173
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,166
As per tradition,
Shiva must be the one to perform.

174
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:47,791
He's an irresponsible fellow.

175
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,250
So, his cousin Guruva
will be performing.

176
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,500
Come for the Kola.
Don’t miss it.

177
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,333
Bring your wife, too.
We'll have a blast.

178
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,166
The owners of all
buffaloes please proceed...

179
00:13:57,166 --> 00:14:00,791
Yes, I was sitting with your wife.
Hit me!

180
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,833
Rampa come! It’s getting late.

181
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:07,583
We are now witnessing Kaadubettu
Shivannaʼs buffaloes entering the field.

182
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,416
FORGE AHEAD!

183
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,458
Let’s charge!

184
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,625
That was awesome, Shiva!

185
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,583
Shiva, you beat your previous
record by two seconds!

186
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,291
That was splendid racing!

187
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,000
Will our buffalo win
at least this time?

188
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:02,000
Just win?
It will break all records!

189
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,833
Just wait and watch Landlord!

190
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,500
It doesn’t matter who wins.

191
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,000
They are our people after all!

192
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,625
Run!

193
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,041
Superb! Our buffaloes made it first!

194
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:27,166
[KUNDAPURA FOLKLORE]

195
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,166
Shiva, slow down. I’m tired.

196
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,458
Tired? Did you run the race?
- Give me the booze.

197
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,666
Pour it.
- It’s hot.

198
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,875
Give it I say.
I'm the one drinking.

199
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,791
I’m leaving.
- Already?

200
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:24,916
Mahadevanna, give me a drag.

201
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,750
Man, our buffaloes ran
like there's no tomorrow!

202
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,500
The buffaloes are running.

203
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:34,416
The buffaloes are running
with all their might.

204
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:41,083
But ironically,
the owner ends up getting the medal.

205
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,375
Bet 10 bucks and take home 20!

206
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:46,666
Bet 10 bucks on
Tiger Prabhakar now!

207
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,625
I bet 10 bucks on Tiger Prabhakar.
- I bet on Silk Smitha.

208
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,250
Yay! Give me the prize!

209
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,208
I won.

210
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:57,875
Move aside.

211
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,750
Shivanna, the Landlord’s buffaloes
finished six seconds later than ours.

212
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:03,916
Let’s go.

213
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,041
Wait.
I’ll bet on Silk Smitha again.

214
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,375
You won’t get her, come.

215
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:11,708
Congratulations!

216
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,083
Lucky you!

217
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,916
Shivanna,
I don’t know how to ride a bike.

218
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:25,250
On behalf of the Keradi ancestral house, we thank all
the 50 buffalo owners who participated in the event.

219
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:31,375
The third place in today's Kambala
race goes to Thumbebailu Mahesh.

220
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:33,458
He bagged it!

221
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,666
The second place goes to….

222
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:36,833
Kaadabettu's...

223
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:40,625
Shivanna's buffaloes.

224
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:42,833
What?

225
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:47,916
The first place in today's Kambala race
goes to Devendra Suttur’s buffaloes.

226
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,833
Oh finally!
Our Landlord won!

227
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:53,250
Which bas*ard said so?!
- Shiva!

228
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,333
If rookies turn into judge,
this is what happens!

229
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,708
I’ll break your leg moron!
How did he win?

230
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,125
You stay out of this!

231
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,875
I’m a big man in this village!

232
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,708
You think you’re the prince of
Barkur, dingbat?!

233
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,166
How did his buffaloes win?
- They ran. So they won. How else?!

234
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,500
Is the Landlord your father to award him?!
- Moron!

235
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,291
Dimwit, you’re the moron!

236
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,708
I’ll kill you scoundrel!

237
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,125
Is your father
judging this contest?

238
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,166
You slob!

239
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:24,000
You guys are destroying the
reputation of the Kambala.

240
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,291
You bash him, Shiva!

241
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,916
Come here, you Landlord’s dog!

242
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,791
Handle the mic with care.
It’s not your father’s!

243
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,291
Don’t you dare talk
about my father!

244
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,875
Landlord!

245
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,500
Smash him!

246
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,000
Wow! Shiva's smashing them!

247
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,458
Don't you see him
getting beaten up?

248
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,125
Whose side are you on?
- I’m on the winner’s side.

249
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:19,791
Go and thrash him!

250
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,875
Thrash him!

251
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,458
God! He's coming here!

252
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:20,916
I’m dead meat!

253
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,541
You wretched dog!

254
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,291
Let’s clean ourselves
at the pond.

255
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,041
The mud has entered the
unmentionable places.

256
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:27,750
Scoundrel!

257
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,791
When the village is together celebrating,
how dare you guys fight instead?

258
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:31,833
You wretched dog!

259
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:35,625
He started it all.
How can I keep quiet?

260
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,041
So? You guys just fight?

261
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,208
His buffaloes have been winning
for the last three years.

262
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,041
Heʼs one of us.
So letʼs support him.

263
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,791
Go bring the medal.

264
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,500
Dammit!

265
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,916
Could it be scotch?
- No clue.

266
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,416
Hey Shiva.
- Landlord?

267
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,750
If you’re pissed with me,
vent it out in front of me.

268
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,541
No need to do it in
front of the villagers.

269
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:55,666
Sorry, Landlord.

270
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,250
Things go out of
hand when I'm drunk.

271
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,125
Then I better be
prepared for more.

272
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,041
Yes!
Wait! No!

273
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,125
Shiva wins it consecutively
for the fourth time.

274
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
God bless!

275
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,000
We are all from
the same village.

276
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,875
We have to live in
harmony till the end.

277
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,666
What do you say?
- You're right.

278
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,375
This is for the
Kola celebrations.

279
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:24,833
Make sure it’s grand.

280
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,541
Let me know if it doesn't suffice.

281
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,291
Okay then.

282
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:30,833
What is it?

283
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,166
Go on. Take it.

284
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,458
Good Lord!
We waited all this while for this!

285
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:37,000
The Landlord is so fond of
us that he thrashed Mohan!

286
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,958
You should have seen his face!

287
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,333
Guddi looked like the cat that
swallowed the canary!

288
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:43,916
Hey Mala, Susheela!

289
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,541
Where are you off to?

290
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:46,708
Look at their attitude!

291
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,208
Where is your sister?

292
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,333
Look at them making faces!

293
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,833
Hey Rampa,
our Landlord is a good man.

294
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,958
He’s the only one who gives
us a party without asking.

295
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,958
Time for some soda!
- One for me too.

296
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,208
What the hell's wrong with you?!

297
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,375
Celebrate our victory man!

298
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:01,583
What rubbish!

299
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:03,875
Ginger?!
Don’t you have a plain one?

300
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,791
That's not it?!
Did I give you the ginger one ?

301
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,291
Yes, damn your ginger!

302
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,000
How much is it?
- Don’t worry, it’s on me.

303
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:10,041
Really?

304
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:12,416
You take the bike and go to Kailasa.
I’ll join you in a bit.

305
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:13,541
Hey Abbu! All good?

306
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:14,583
Yes.

307
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,833
Haven’t you gone to the mosque?
- You think I live there?

308
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:19,500
Shiva is bad company for my
son, Lacchu!

309
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:20,625
Hey Vasanthi akka (sister)!

310
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:22,541
Hope he doesn't lose his way.
- Move aside!

311
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:24,708
Use the horn, monkey!
- Namaskara!

312
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,083
Looks like it's finally yours.
- Could it be anyone else's?

313
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,333
Where is Lacchu?
- What?!

314
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:30,333
Did he go out hunting?
- Shiva!

315
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,125
Greetings uncle.
- Hey Shiva.

316
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:36,166
This is the Landlord’s
donation for the Kola.

317
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,125
He wants us to ask
if we need more.

318
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:40,416
Has there ever been instance
where he hasn’t given enough?

319
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:42,375
Hey Guruva!
This time too the medal is ours.

320
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:43,750
Everybody knew that you won.

321
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:45,083
Did you need this
medal to prove it?

322
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:47,000
Why should I let go of
what’s rightfully mine?

323
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,916
I need your blessings.
- It’s okay!

324
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:52,416
Man, he really got Mohana yesterday.
- Real bad.

325
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,250
Kusuma.

326
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,250
You stay here. I’ll come.

327
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,458
Why do you need medicine?
What happened?

328
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,416
I saw something last
night and freaked out.

329
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:07,541
What did you see?
- It was me.

330
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:10,833
I'm tired of trying to
convince him that it was me.

331
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:11,875
Well...

332
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:13,875
I wonder how many more
nightmares await him.

333
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,833
The fighter cock is here.

334
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:19,750
You called him useless but
he managed to get the medal.

335
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:21,750
He didn’t get it for the
race, but for wrestling.

336
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:23,833
He’s the black sheep of his
family and this village.

337
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Hey Kapil and Deva.

338
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,125
There’s only one medal.
Kindly adjust.

339
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,250
Where’s mother?

340
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:29,625
Hasn’t she fed you yet?

341
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:30,625
It’s right here.

342
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:33,041
Eat well.

343
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:36,208
Next year,
we should break this year’s record.

344
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,041
If we win, I'll get two medals.

345
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,125
What did you hunt, Lacchu?

346
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:41,166
A hen.

347
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:42,916
A hen?
You didn’t have to hunt it.

348
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:44,416
You could’ve just caught it.

349
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:47,208
A wild hen dude.
- Where is Rampa?

350
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,958
Sire set off in the dawn,
asking me to wait for him.

351
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,541
Shivanna, when will you
teach me to ride the bike?

352
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,333
Rampa will train you to ride.

353
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:56,791
He is out riding right now.

354
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:58,833
Shall I go and join him?

355
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,541
Don’t interrupt the ride midway.

356
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:01,875
The bike may jerk to a halt!

357
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:06,833
This is for Rampa.

358
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:08,666
This too.

359
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:10,375
Let’s finish it off
before he comes.

360
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:11,833
Bulla!

361
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,583
Damn, he’s here!

362
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:16,083
Did you take a shower?
- I didn’t get time.

363
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:19,541
Mud on your knees?!

364
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,791
Did you fall off the bike?

365
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:22,166
Well...

366
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:25,583
I attempted to do this and
something else happened.

367
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:29,166
Rampanna, I heard you ride well.

368
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:30,541
I want to ride too.

369
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:32,666
Shut up and eat.

370
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:35,583
Hey, this is not boar meat!

371
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,583
Guys, shall we go hunting tonight?
- Yes.

372
00:24:42,541 --> 00:24:45,458
Shiva! Where is that dog?

373
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,291
Let me get my hands on him!
I’ll thrash him!

374
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:49,833
Hey! Shivanna!
Where are you off to?

375
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:51,416
Weren't we going in
the night to hunt?

376
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:53,125
Then why did he run now?
- No clue.

377
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:56,083
Bulla, look!

378
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:57,916
Kamala is walking upside down!

379
00:24:57,916 --> 00:25:00,333
Look at the stick her in hand!
- This one will hurt!

380
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:03,791
Wastrel!
Look at him hiding in that tree!

381
00:25:03,958 --> 00:25:04,958
Shameless bugger!

382
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,916
Didn’t I tell you not
to hunt wild boars?

383
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:08,750
You’re fit for roaming
the streets like a dog!

384
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:10,250
Damn! Who told you we
hunted a wild boar?

385
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:11,291
It was a wild hen!

386
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:13,833
You shameless liar!

387
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:16,083
Kamala,
we really hunted a wild hen.

388
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:17,708
Not a wild boar.
Check if you want.

389
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:18,958
Dimwit! You stay out of this!

390
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,041
Had you gotten married at the right
age, you’d have had kids by now.

391
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:23,500
Would you have spoilt
them like this?

392
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:25,708
Despite your age, you have no brains!
Bloody wretch!

393
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,750
What can I do if you
got married at 13?

394
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:29,250
Why are you laughing?

395
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:31,083
What are you doing
with this old man?

396
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:33,250
I came to Ramappa to learn to ride!
- Kamala!

397
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,375
What’s the matter with you?

398
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:35,875
You think you’re a teenager?

399
00:25:35,958 --> 00:25:37,958
Hope you remember we studied
together till Class 3.

400
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I have been witnessing
your nonsense ever since.

401
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:41,958
Kamala, are you high?
What makes you speak like this?

402
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
You shut your mouth!

403
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,250
You, come home!

404
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:45,458
Your funeral awaits you!

405
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,208
I’m sick of this fellow.

406
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:49,416
What a crazy woman!
- This is exactly why I quit school!

407
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:51,833
Let’s cancel tonight’s
hunting plans.

408
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:53,250
We've to attend
your funeral, right?

409
00:25:53,291 --> 00:25:54,291
Bugger off!

410
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:56,375
We hunted last night.
Haven't slept a wink.

411
00:25:56,416 --> 00:25:58,500
We decided to offer it
first to you and came by.

412
00:25:58,541 --> 00:26:00,333
Sir, please don’t mind.

413
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:02,458
It's a small wild boar.

414
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,458
Next time, we'll hunt a big one!

415
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:11,916
Irrespective of its size,
it's our duty to offer you the meat.

416
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:14,708
The Deputy Forest
Officer is here!

417
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:18,791
Sir, greetings!
- How are you doing, Raghu?

418
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:19,833
Doing well sir.

419
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:21,333
Sir please spare us!

420
00:26:21,541 --> 00:26:22,833
What's that sound?

421
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:24,416
Sir, some repair work is going on.

422
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:28,583
Is the forest your
ancestral property?

423
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:29,958
Will you hunt again?!

424
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:32,208
Morons! Will you hunt again?

425
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,500
Murali!

426
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:44,625
Are you acting smart because
there is no RFO in this division?

427
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:47,875
At this rate, they will hunt
all the animals in the forest.

428
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:48,916
So?

429
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:53,000
If you torture people in your custody,
they will torture you outside.

430
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:55,041
This is a sensitive area.

431
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:58,625
If you don't learn to handle the
people, the road ahead looks tough.

432
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:06,291
Listen,
I donʼt eat meat on Thursday.

433
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:07,833
You can go.

434
00:27:09,916 --> 00:27:12,000
So many survey stones
have been moved.

435
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:15,166
Finish the survey soon
and submit the reports.

436
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:18,291
There are three villages
left apart from Kaadubettu.

437
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,083
Oy! Who goes there?

438
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:26,708
Come here.

439
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:29,291
Whatʼs all this?

440
00:27:31,791 --> 00:27:32,958
I'm asking you. What is this?

441
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:35,958
Different kinds of produce...
- I know that.

442
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:39,500
Do you have permission to take
all this from a reserve forest?

443
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:40,583
What for?

444
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:43,041
Every year, we take all this from
the forest for the Bhootha Kola.

445
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:45,291
Donʼt you know itʼs
an offence to do so?

446
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:47,166
Guys, today letʼs hunt
at least four wild boars.

447
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,625
Why? One is enough.

448
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:51,916
Letʼs go.
You can burn some calories.

449
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:53,791
Hey, forest officer! Hide!

450
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,708
Take the guns and come
from the other side.

451
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,750
Then where should we
get the produce from?

452
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:01,833
Thatʼs not my problem.

453
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:02,875
So what can we do now?

454
00:28:02,916 --> 00:28:06,250
Henceforth, you have to take my permission
if you have to do anything in the forest.

455
00:28:07,791 --> 00:28:10,291
Whatʼs the issue?

456
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:15,333
Shiva, this man says we need his permission
to bring produce from the forest.

457
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:18,208
Is it?
Do we have to take permission?

458
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:19,958
The government won't
spare you if you don't.

459
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,041
Dammit! We've been living here much before
your government came into the picture.

460
00:28:23,041 --> 00:28:24,875
If you think about it,
you need our permission.

461
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:27,291
Do you have it?
Speak up.

462
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:28,833
No, right?

463
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:31,916
You don’t need any permission Vasanthiakka.
You can go.

464
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:33,583
Okay!

465
00:28:33,583 --> 00:28:35,291
You guys leave!
It’s so damn hot!

466
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:37,291
Itʼs a big deal we
let you in the forest!

467
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:38,375
A map, eh?

468
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,083
Hey, where can I find
Parapaade on the map?

469
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:41,541
I guess you donʼt know either.

470
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:43,958
They are also searching for the same!
- Is it? Continue.

471
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:46,333
Okay, carry on!

472
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,208
Let me know if you find it.

473
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,958
Ravi. -
- Sir?

474
00:28:51,416 --> 00:28:53,416
Patrol near Parapaade tonight.
- Okay sir.

475
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:56,083
Lacchu, have I told you
my grandfather's story?

476
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:57,458
Damn! There he goes again!

477
00:28:57,458 --> 00:28:58,625
1850.

478
00:28:58,625 --> 00:28:59,916
This was the time of the Kings.

479
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:02,416
During the reign of
King Gajendra Simha....

480
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:06,500
The King and my Grandpa Thaniya,
the brave warrior were close friends.

481
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:10,125
The King once took my
Grandpa for a hunt.

482
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,916
They hunted 14 wild boars in
the course of their banter.

483
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:14,041
My god!

484
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:16,083
When they went ahead,
they found another one.

485
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:18,041
A Wild boar?
- No dude. It was a tiger.

486
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:19,375
Oh!
What happened?

487
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:21,208
Shush!
- What is it Shivanna?

488
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:28,875
Hey! What is it?

489
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:32,125
I didnʼt spot anything. Did you?

490
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:34,208
I can't spot
anything but tigers.

491
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:40,125
[GUNSHOT]

492
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:00,041
Hey Shiva! What happened?

493
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:02,416
Nothing dude.
- He shot something, didnʼt he?

494
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:04,291
Letʼs search for it.
- I didnʼt see it too.

495
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:05,833
Shiva!
- We wonʼt find it. Letʼs go.

496
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:08,916
Lacchu,
where were we in the story?

497
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,625
The tiger was eyeing
the King as its prey.

498
00:30:12,666 --> 00:30:15,166
But the King was looking
at the tiger as his prey.

499
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:17,541
He took out the gun and
pressed the trigger.

500
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:18,875
Boom!

501
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,375
Whatʼs that?
- Boom Boom!

502
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,666
What's happening?!
- The bloody gun didnʼt fire.

503
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,708
The tiger came
pouncing at the king.

504
00:30:24,916 --> 00:30:27,333
Suddenly,
my Grandpa grabbed the Kingʼs gun.

505
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:31,625
He rammed it against the ground twice, gave it a
jerk, aimed it to the ground and took his shot.

506
00:30:31,791 --> 00:30:32,791
Boom!

507
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:34,791
The gun fired and the
tiger died on the spot!

508
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,791
How did the tiger die if he
aimed the gun at the ground?

509
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:39,125
The bullet bounced
off and hit the tiger.

510
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:40,333
It died on the spot!

511
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:41,750
What a useless gun!

512
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:45,583
Shut up! That very gun was gifted to my
Grandpa in the grand court of the the King.

513
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:46,583
Okay dude.

514
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:47,625
Shush!

515
00:30:58,625 --> 00:30:59,666
Hey stop!

516
00:30:59,666 --> 00:31:01,125
Itʼs wounded. Letʼs chase it!

517
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:02,583
I heard a sound from this side.

518
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:03,875
Rampa, shoot it, idiot!

519
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,625
Heʼs useless!
Why did you bring him?

520
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:09,458
Iʼm not going to use
this old manʼs gun!

521
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,375
If you come hunting again,
Iʼll break your leg!

522
00:31:11,916 --> 00:31:12,916
Fire quickly!

523
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:14,166
I canʼt fire with this gun!

524
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:15,833
Go to the other side
and shoot you moron!

525
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:17,625
Why hold a gun if you
canʼt shoot, bonehead?!

526
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:20,083
Stand away from me,
else I'll die here.

527
00:31:22,291 --> 00:31:23,291
Come on.

528
00:31:28,791 --> 00:31:30,041
Bloody boar!

529
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:32,041
Didnʼt I tell you?

530
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:34,000
My Grandpa's gun never
fails to bring us meat.

531
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,125
Look, such a big one!

532
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:38,541
It’s so huge!
Must be Bullaʼs relative.

533
00:31:39,583 --> 00:31:40,625
Letʼs hunt another one.

534
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:42,958
Donʼt be an idiot!
We can't do it all over again!

535
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,375
One is enough. Letʼs go back.

536
00:31:44,416 --> 00:31:45,875
Is this all youʼre capable of?
Okay then.

537
00:31:45,916 --> 00:31:47,000
Tie it up. Letʼs go.

538
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:50,375
Didnʼt we shoot a boar here?

539
00:31:50,416 --> 00:31:51,875
We won't find it. Let's go.

540
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:53,958
Let's try and look here.

541
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,125
Look all over and you'll
find your Grandpa's remains.

542
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:58,333
Was your grandfather buried here too?

543
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,333
If your mother finds out about this
hunt, she’ll thrash you.

544
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:13,791
I won’t let her beat him.

545
00:32:14,416 --> 00:32:15,958
That portion of the meat
is for the Landlord.

546
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:17,875
The other portion is
for my grandpa’s gun.

547
00:32:17,916 --> 00:32:19,458
Okay, cut the meat now.

548
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:01,708
Did you have your dinner?

549
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:28,208
This moron won't get it.

550
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,375
I'll kill you today.

551
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:30,708
Imbecile!

552
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:33,166
Did you go hunting again?
You just wonʼt listen!

553
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:34,416
What's wrong?

554
00:33:34,416 --> 00:33:36,500
What happened?
Let me explain it to you in detail!

555
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,541
You mongrel!

556
00:33:37,541 --> 00:33:39,458
Shiva, we're hungry.
Got anything to eat?

557
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,333
No, my mother will
give you a earful! Run!

558
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:43,083
You guys are here?!
Youʼre the one spoiling him!

559
00:33:43,083 --> 00:33:44,375
Kamala, listen to me.

560
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,500
Rampa, come.

561
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:47,541
Dimwits! Wait for me!

562
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:51,791
Did it hurt?
- Not really.

563
00:33:51,791 --> 00:33:53,291
Heʼs used to it.

564
00:33:53,291 --> 00:33:54,291
Yes!

565
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:57,458
Shiva, where were you last night?

566
00:33:57,791 --> 00:33:59,791
My mother was home and
is scared to sleep alone.

567
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:01,333
I went home to be with her.

568
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:03,666
Despite you caring for her so
much, she has no sympathy.

569
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,541
Stop at Mahadevachariʼs house.
I have some work.

570
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:08,916
Mahadevanna, How are you?

571
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:11,125
You guys carry on.
I have to get my bum repaired.

572
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:12,958
What?
- Sorry, my gun repaired.

573
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:21,125
Thimmappa, take them in.

574
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,583
Get the others to
unload the vehicle.

575
00:34:25,916 --> 00:34:27,041
Yes, Sudhakar?
- Sir...

576
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,666
The thing is...

577
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:32,125
If payments keep getting delayed,
how do I get the labour folk?

578
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:33,333
Iʼm helpless too.

579
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:35,875
Since the RFO is suspended,
none of the bills are getting through.

580
00:34:35,916 --> 00:34:38,375
Sir, you are doing
most of his work.

581
00:34:38,416 --> 00:34:40,375
Wish you could do something
about the payment too.

582
00:34:40,416 --> 00:34:42,416
Give me some time Sudhakar.
I’ll get it done.

583
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:45,291
Sir, the Landlord had invited you home.
I'd told you.

584
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,458
I forgot.
- I thought so.

585
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:49,041
Iʼll go.

586
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:50,375
Okay then. Iʼll take a leave.

587
00:34:51,875 --> 00:34:52,875
All good?

588
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:58,333
Sir, we heard two gunshots
in the forest yesterday.

589
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:00,041
Hunting has taken place for sure.

590
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:01,625
But we didnʼt find them.

591
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:04,541
However,
we found this near Parapaade.

592
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:05,583
Whatʼs this?

593
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:06,958
The head ornament
of the Demigod.

594
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,416
Seems ancient.

595
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:14,375
It commands more respect
than a King’s crown.

596
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:20,333
Looks like a massive boar!

597
00:35:21,125 --> 00:35:22,500
Yes. Weighs 40 kilos.

598
00:35:22,541 --> 00:35:24,583
If itʼs leg weighed 40 kilos,
did the boar weigh 500 kilos?

599
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:26,041
We meant the boar
weighs 40 kilos.

600
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:29,250
Mohan, there is a bag on
the table inside. Bring it.

601
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,250
Okay Landlord.

602
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:31,875
One more thing.

603
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:34,916
Ensure that your land
documents are in place.

604
00:35:34,916 --> 00:35:36,833
The department has
begun the survey.

605
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,333
Really?

606
00:35:38,333 --> 00:35:40,875
Why else did I call you over?
- But they didn't inform me.

607
00:35:40,916 --> 00:35:41,958
Keep quiet.

608
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:44,375
Keep the correct documents, okay?
- Okay Landlord.

609
00:35:44,416 --> 00:35:46,416
Youʼve been nodding your
heads for many years now.

610
00:35:46,416 --> 00:35:48,083
Our people donʼt
understand these things.

611
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:50,041
If you donʼt understand,
you must ask me.

612
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:51,708
Why the hell did
you call me here?

613
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:53,708
Calm down man! Take it easy.

614
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,375
If we donʼt get it.
You'll handle it, right?

615
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:56,416
Of course, Iʼm here.

616
00:35:57,541 --> 00:36:00,416
Next time, see if you can
hunt something with spots!

617
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:01,541
Sure.

618
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,125
Let the Bhootha Kola get over.

619
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:05,333
What does he mean spotted?
A leopard?

620
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:06,583
Deer, you idiot!

621
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:07,583
Give it here.

622
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:09,958
Take it.

623
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:11,166
Hey Venkatramana, letʼs go.

624
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:17,583
Hey Jagga! Mohan!

625
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:20,291
Load the rice bags, vegetables
and fruits in the officer's jeep.

626
00:36:20,333 --> 00:36:21,708
Take it.
- Pick them up.

627
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:24,708
Please come!

628
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,333
Whatʼs all this?

629
00:36:26,375 --> 00:36:27,583
Youʼre our guest.

630
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:29,625
How can I send you
back empty-handed?

631
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:31,250
Come letʼs chat
over a cup of tea.

632
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:36,833
Hope things are going
fine in the village.

633
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:43,625
I hear youʼre set to conduct
survey in our village.

634
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:46,333
You know our people, right?

635
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:48,208
Their livelihood
depends on this forest.

636
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:49,458
They're uneducated.

637
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,875
I suggest you grin
and bear with it.

638
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:55,041
The previous officer was
in good terms with me.

639
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:58,875
Please ensure that we
donʼt face any troubles.

640
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:01,333
Iʼd say itʼs better if you
ensure that there is no trouble.

641
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:03,708
My work will be on.

642
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:06,875
Let me know when
there are festivals.

643
00:37:06,916 --> 00:37:08,375
Iʼll come over for food.

644
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,583
My wife isnʼt at home.

645
00:37:10,791 --> 00:37:12,916
She left me because I don't
grin and bear with things.

646
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:17,625
See you.

647
00:37:17,625 --> 00:37:18,625
Sure.

648
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:22,708
Sir, this is the boundary
of the forest department.

649
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:24,750
Encroachment has been
noticed in these two regions.

650
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:27,125
This belongs to Devendra Suttur
and this to the villagers.

651
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:28,958
I have issued notice to
the concerned parties.

652
00:37:28,958 --> 00:37:31,083
Sending notice to the
villagers wonʼt work.

653
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:32,541
You have to convince them.

654
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,416
Sir, these villagers
are a little bonkers.

655
00:37:34,416 --> 00:37:36,083
If you confront them,
they pounce on you.

656
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:37,916
All government officers
say the same story.

657
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:40,500
But it shouldnʼt become the
excuse for our incompetence.

Whatʼs that?

679
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:01,041
Bhootha Kola has begun.

680
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:03,458
Itʼs an annual ritual
that is celebrated.

681
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:08,166
Take out the vehicle.

682
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:11,208
I heard the forest officer was
acting too smart the other day.

683
00:39:11,625 --> 00:39:13,416
Had I been there,
Iʼd have slapped him!

684
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:15,208
You seem like an angry
man, aren't you?

685
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:18,458
When I get angry,
I canʼt tolerate injustice.

My body begins to...

00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,208

it is the government’s job, isnʼt it sir?

I trust that you will
handle this efficiently.

You havenʼt spoken to sir yet?
- No.

name on the list?

No, sir.

960
00:53:59,166 --> 00:54:01,416
He will realise what it means
to have his a** on fire.

961
00:54:01,458 --> 00:54:03,416
Sir, this is a sensitive matter.

962
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:06,125
Since we are dealing with
land, they might react.

963
00:54:06,166 --> 00:54:07,416
Who are they to react?

964
00:54:07,458 --> 00:54:09,291
Itʼs forest land.
So itʼs us who have to react.

965
00:54:09,666 --> 00:54:11,500
We will have to make
them understand sir.

966
00:54:11,708 --> 00:54:13,708
If it doesnʼt go right,
then we will be in trouble.

967
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,583
This time weʼll definitely
make them understand.

- Sir.

00:54:19,208 --> 00:54:20,583

sheʼs been trained.

00:54:40,958 --> 00:54:41,958

Just come!

994
00:55:30,333 --> 00:55:31,375
Speak.

995
00:55:31,375 --> 00:55:32,708
They're your
people, aren't they?

996
00:55:32,708 --> 00:55:34,333
They would rather
listen to you than me.

997
00:55:34,375 --> 00:55:35,750
Leela, whatʼs the matter?

998
00:55:38,833 --> 00:55:39,916
Go stand at the back.

999
00:55:39,916 --> 00:55:42,125
This is the result when you
use influence to get a job.

1000
00:55:43,916 --> 00:55:45,208
This is a government order.

1001
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:47,708
The department has to measure
the circumference of the forest.

1002
00:55:47,916 --> 00:55:50,625
We will have to report
the encroachment.

1003
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:52,041
Am I clear?

00:55:54,083 --> 00:55:56,291

1005
00:55:56,625 --> 00:55:58,750
Follow the officer.

1006
00:55:59,166 --> 00:56:00,166
Go there.

1007
00:56:00,208 --> 00:56:01,500
Start surveying from that stone.

1008
00:56:01,916 --> 00:56:04,083
Make way! Let them work.

1009
00:56:04,083 --> 00:56:05,458
Drag the chain to that stone.

1010
00:56:05,458 --> 00:56:06,750
Bring the chain this side.

1011
00:56:06,791 --> 00:56:09,208
What attachment are
you talking about?

1012
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:10,833
Itʼs not attachment.
Itʼs encroachment.

1013
00:56:10,833 --> 00:56:12,708
I got that. What does it mean?

1014
00:56:12,708 --> 00:56:13,916
Whatʼs your name?

1015
00:56:13,958 --> 00:56:15,291
Attachment.
I mean.. Sundar.

1016
00:56:16,375 --> 00:56:18,708
Sundar, encroachment means
illegally occupied land.

1017
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,041
Issue a notice to the concerned.

1018
00:56:20,041 --> 00:56:21,041
Go fast!

1019
00:56:21,208 --> 00:56:23,500
You were supposed to reply to the notice.
But you havenʼt.

1020
00:56:23,541 --> 00:56:26,416
We were busy! What now?

1021
00:56:27,041 --> 00:56:29,541
I know. Thatʼs why we are here.

1022
00:56:30,208 --> 00:56:31,708
We are peaceful people.

1023
00:56:32,041 --> 00:56:34,291
Just don't provoke us.

1024
00:56:34,333 --> 00:56:37,291
If we claim your land,
will you be okay with it?

1025
00:56:37,333 --> 00:56:38,458
You have done that already.

1026
00:56:38,791 --> 00:56:40,208
You've fenced our land.

1027
00:56:40,708 --> 00:56:42,666
Itʼs a one hour job.

1028
00:56:42,958 --> 00:56:46,291
We will shift the stones which your ancestors
and you have been moving since years.

1029
00:56:46,291 --> 00:56:48,791
This will not happen
as long as Iʼm alive!

1030
00:56:48,833 --> 00:56:50,458
Hey Sundar. Hold on.
Try stopping us.

1031
00:56:50,458 --> 00:56:51,916
Ay! Go back.

1032
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:53,833
Once I take a step
forward, I won't step back.

1033
00:56:53,833 --> 00:56:55,750
On the night of Kola,
I was held back.

1034
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:57,250
Are you showing off?

1035
00:56:57,958 --> 00:56:59,583
You donʼt have to pull
your gun for that.

1036
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:02,291
I have a gun too.
It'll take time for me to bring it.

1037
00:57:03,166 --> 00:57:04,708
I said get back!!

1038
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:06,041
Donʼt touch us!

1039
00:57:06,083 --> 00:57:07,291
Youʼre acting too smart.

1040
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:08,541
I can fight too!

1041
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:09,625
Go back, I said!

1042
00:57:12,708 --> 00:57:13,708
Where's Shiva?

1043
00:57:16,458 --> 00:57:19,125
Shivanna!
The forest officer is troubling us!

1044
00:57:20,125 --> 00:57:21,708
Leela, what are you doing dear?

1045
00:57:21,708 --> 00:57:23,708
You've joined them to
fence your own land?

1046
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:25,333
Please let me do my job dad.

1047
00:57:25,458 --> 00:57:27,291
We don't need this
insensitive job.

1048
00:57:28,291 --> 00:57:30,708
Shut up people!

1049
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:32,083
Go on, speak.

1050
00:57:32,416 --> 00:57:34,041
You guys just donʼt
respect my words.

1051
00:57:34,583 --> 00:57:35,875
Go on!
- Now listen.

1052
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,333
Even I donʼt know
whatʼs happening.

1053
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:40,500
Then why the hell
are you talking?!

1054
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,250
I mean I donʼt know the
procedures involved.

1055
00:57:42,291 --> 00:57:43,750
Why are you pouncing
on me for that?!

1056
00:57:44,083 --> 00:57:47,000
After all,
he also has to perform his duty.

1057
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,958
He'll be under pressure too.
- For what?!

1058
00:57:48,958 --> 00:57:50,708
Voting for you was
our biggest mistake.

1059
00:57:50,708 --> 00:57:52,125
Now youʼre also on his side!

1060
00:57:52,125 --> 00:57:54,708
No way!
Only the labourers were mine.

1061
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:56,666
Iʼm on your side!
- Enough. We donʼt believe you.

1062
00:57:56,666 --> 00:57:58,583
We know what to do.
Come letʼs go.

1063
00:57:58,625 --> 00:57:59,708
Please listen to me!

1064
00:57:59,708 --> 00:58:01,250
Don't my words have
any value at all?

1065
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:02,291
Hey, get lost!

1066
00:58:02,333 --> 00:58:04,958
Wait!
Donʼt disturb while marking.

1067
00:58:08,875 --> 00:58:10,583
Who are you to mark our land?

1068
00:58:16,916 --> 00:58:18,333
Thrash him right!

1069
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:23,583
Sir!

1070
00:58:25,291 --> 00:58:26,291
Police!

1071
00:59:07,541 --> 00:59:09,166
Rabid dog!

1072
00:59:19,166 --> 00:59:20,208
Come to me! You jackas*!

1073
00:59:47,958 --> 00:59:50,583
I will finish you today, Bas*ard!

1074
00:59:55,166 --> 00:59:56,166
[GUNSHOT]

1075
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:02,791
What's the big deal
about firing in the air?!

1076
01:00:02,791 --> 01:00:04,916
Shoot me directly if
you have the guts!

1077
01:00:04,958 --> 01:00:06,000
Shoot!

1078
01:00:06,458 --> 01:00:07,458
[GUNSHOT]

1079
01:00:10,833 --> 01:00:12,208
I didnʼt miss my aim.

1080
01:00:12,791 --> 01:00:14,166
I'm a trained officer.

1081
01:00:15,791 --> 01:00:16,791
Tie him up.

1082
01:00:37,833 --> 01:00:39,875
You have done the right
thing, sir.

1083
01:00:40,291 --> 01:00:42,291
Go inside!
Iʼll kick you all behind bars.

1084
01:00:53,541 --> 01:00:54,541
Take care.

1085
01:01:03,791 --> 01:01:06,333
Youʼre still wearing that
uniform, girl?

1086
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:08,166
We thought you'll get
educated and help us.

1087
01:01:08,208 --> 01:01:09,666
But you back stabbed us.

1088
01:01:18,291 --> 01:01:20,000
Heʼs not eaten
anything since morning.

1089
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:35,708
Shiva!

1090
01:01:38,166 --> 01:01:40,125
I heard you didn't
eat since morning.

1091
01:01:47,625 --> 01:01:48,666
Get lost!

1092
01:01:48,666 --> 01:01:49,750
Leela!

1093
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:51,958
How dare you beat up a girl!

1094
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:55,291
This was the last thing
I expected from you!

1095
01:01:55,291 --> 01:01:56,666
Where are you going?! Stop!

1096
01:02:01,583 --> 01:02:05,583
How would I know that they would ask
me to do this on the first day at work?!

1097
01:02:06,791 --> 01:02:09,708
None of you understand
my situation!

1098
01:02:19,083 --> 01:02:20,083
Annappa.

1099
01:02:22,333 --> 01:02:25,375
If you submit a request for the title
deed, things will move fast.

1100
01:02:25,416 --> 01:02:26,416
Illiterates!

1101
01:02:26,458 --> 01:02:27,458
Naru.

1102
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,250
Naru, be quick.

1103
01:02:29,958 --> 01:02:31,875
None of your
documents are in place.

1104
01:02:31,875 --> 01:02:33,625
Itʼs been a while,
must have gathered dust.

1105
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:36,291
Screw the dust!
I can't read a single letter.

1106
01:02:36,333 --> 01:02:37,333
Damn.

1107
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:39,250
Who is Thukra?

1108
01:02:40,541 --> 01:02:42,083
Itʼs my father.
- What?

1109
01:02:42,583 --> 01:02:44,041
Whose document is this?
Itʼs mine.

1110
01:02:44,375 --> 01:02:46,875
How did his documents get
registered in your father’s name?

1111
01:02:46,875 --> 01:02:48,833
Both our fathers have
the same name - Thukra.

1112
01:02:49,916 --> 01:02:52,291
These Thukras are trouble!

1113
01:02:52,333 --> 01:02:53,333
Apply your thumb imprint.

1114
01:02:53,541 --> 01:02:55,583
Whose ration card is this?
- Itʼs mine! Abu.

1115
01:02:56,041 --> 01:02:58,083
You think Iʼm selling
rice, here?

1116
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:00,583
What the hell?!

1117
01:03:01,125 --> 01:03:02,541
Tell me if youʼre
not selling rice.

1118
01:03:02,583 --> 01:03:03,625
Why get angry for that?

1119
01:03:03,666 --> 01:03:05,041
What?
- The house is beautiful.

1120
01:03:05,041 --> 01:03:06,708
As if he's giving rice
from his own kitchen.

1121
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:11,125
I want the documents in place or else
it will be tough to argue in court.

1122
01:03:12,458 --> 01:03:13,791
What is it?

1123
01:03:18,291 --> 01:03:20,458
How dare you step in?!
You mongrel!

1124
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:33,458
Hey brother, stop!!
- Moron! Iʼll kill you!

1125
01:03:33,458 --> 01:03:34,458
Bulla, donʼt step in.

1126
01:03:36,666 --> 01:03:39,291
Mohan, go mind your business!

1127
01:03:44,125 --> 01:03:45,166
Shiva!
- Yes Landlord?

1128
01:03:45,208 --> 01:03:46,375
Nothing to worry.

1129
01:03:46,375 --> 01:03:47,958
He is always tension free!

1130
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:49,291
This is for you. Enjoy.

1131
01:03:49,291 --> 01:03:50,291
Please have the drink.

1132
01:03:50,333 --> 01:03:51,375
Landlord, what about you?

1133
01:03:51,375 --> 01:03:52,916
Iʼll have. You please drink.
- Okay.

1134
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:54,125
Please relax.
- Okay.

1135
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:59,541
Don't chug insane amount of alcohol just
because it's free. Watch the intake!

1136
01:04:03,208 --> 01:04:07,125
He hit me in front of everyone but
this Landlord too supports him.

1137
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:10,333
Exactly. Are you a rabid dog
to get treated like that?

1138
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:12,750
Mohan.

1139
01:04:13,708 --> 01:04:15,291
Every dog has its day.

1140
01:04:16,625 --> 01:04:17,750
We shall bite then.

1141
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:23,833
You please carry on.
Iʼll be back soon.

1142
01:04:23,875 --> 01:04:25,125
Sir, peanuts?

1143
01:04:29,375 --> 01:04:31,666
I hope our land will be safe.

1144
01:04:32,416 --> 01:04:34,291
Why are you requesting me?

1145
01:04:35,166 --> 01:04:37,833
You are like our
Landlord, Shivanna.

1146
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:48,416
Where do you think my land is?
Itʼs right beside the forest.

1147
01:04:48,833 --> 01:04:52,208
They marked my land
as encroachment.

1148
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:53,250
Then?

1149
01:04:53,291 --> 01:04:57,958
Then I realised I didnʼt
have the right documents.

1150
01:04:57,958 --> 01:04:58,958
Oh!

1151
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:00,541
Now?

1152
01:05:00,583 --> 01:05:08,541
A lawyer called Subbarao is
fighting the case since 12 years.

1153
01:05:10,083 --> 01:05:11,208
Someday, I might win.

1154
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:12,250
Shiva!

1155
01:05:12,458 --> 01:05:13,458
Yes, Landlord.

1156
01:05:13,458 --> 01:05:15,291
We need to water the plantation.
Shall we go?

1157
01:05:15,291 --> 01:05:16,458
Okay.

1158
01:05:21,833 --> 01:05:23,125
Be quick.
- Shiva, take this.

1159
01:05:25,208 --> 01:05:26,250
Take the flash light.

1160
01:05:26,291 --> 01:05:27,958
Careful.
- Okay Ammakka.

1161
01:05:28,208 --> 01:05:29,416
You think they realised?

1162
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:30,916
They were all in a
buzz, Landlord.

1163
01:05:31,083 --> 01:05:33,125
Shiva, what happened
to that match of yours?

1164
01:05:33,375 --> 01:05:34,875
Seen her on your bike often.

1165
01:05:34,916 --> 01:05:36,041
What happened to it?

1166
01:05:36,458 --> 01:05:37,750
We were going strong.

1167
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:40,166
Until this forest officer spoilt it for us.
We broke up.

1168
01:05:40,208 --> 01:05:42,125
Can you get her removed from the
job, Landlord?

1169
01:05:42,166 --> 01:05:43,666
What can the poor girl do?

1170
01:05:43,666 --> 01:05:45,458
She only followed
the DRFOʼs orders.

1171
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:47,041
Can you get him
removed from his post?

1172
01:05:47,375 --> 01:05:49,500
Itʼs not so easy Shiva.

1173
01:05:50,333 --> 01:05:52,791
If heʼs not performing his
duty, then we can try.

1174
01:05:52,833 --> 01:05:53,916
Is it so?

1175
01:05:54,041 --> 01:05:56,083
Then letʼs ensure he
doesnʼt perform his duty.

1176
01:05:56,208 --> 01:05:57,958
Besides, we have you with us.

1177
01:05:58,791 --> 01:06:00,166
Youʼre a smart guy Shiva!

1178
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:02,833
You get things instantly!

1179
01:06:07,375 --> 01:06:09,458
The signal's here.
- Careful, my lord.

1180
01:06:17,625 --> 01:06:18,666
Come fast lady.

1181
01:07:02,791 --> 01:07:03,875
What happened?

1182
01:07:03,875 --> 01:07:05,875
What happened, Shiva?
- I saw something there. Run!

1183
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:09,166
What happened?
Tell me what is it.

1184
01:07:09,208 --> 01:07:11,083
Hold the torch you idiot!
I can't see anything.

1185
01:07:11,083 --> 01:07:14,000
Take this! You can return it
if we make it out of here alive!

1186
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,958
I was in a hurry because
her husband would return.

1187
01:07:16,083 --> 01:07:17,583
Shiva!
I'm going! You go home too!

1188
01:07:17,583 --> 01:07:19,375
Shiva! Stop!

1189
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:36,666
When will you realise not to
roam the forest at such hours?

1190
01:07:36,666 --> 01:07:39,166
This is what you get for getting
into worthless adventures.

1191
01:07:39,416 --> 01:07:40,750
Don't get started.

1192
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:41,958
Let him recover.

1193
01:07:44,875 --> 01:07:46,750
I’m advising because
you’re younger to me.

1194
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:49,625
At your age, your father would visit
couple of villages to perform Kola.

1195
01:07:49,666 --> 01:07:51,250
Why don't you get it?

1196
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:52,291
Why will he get it?

1197
01:07:52,333 --> 01:07:55,375
If he's busy with these wastrels,
how will he have time for anything else?

1198
01:07:55,416 --> 01:07:57,750
Why blame us for nothing?
Did we blind him?

1199
01:07:57,916 --> 01:07:59,333
I'll punch you. Shut up!

1200
01:07:59,583 --> 01:08:01,375
Why keep blaming
us for everything?

1201
01:08:01,541 --> 01:08:02,666
Let's get out.

1202
01:08:03,708 --> 01:08:05,125
We'll wait outside. Take care.

1203
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:08,000
If you have something to
say, tell it to me.

1204
01:08:08,041 --> 01:08:09,166
Why blame others?

1205
01:08:09,708 --> 01:08:11,083
You sure get angry
for everything.

1206
01:08:11,125 --> 01:08:14,083
Enough now.
Let's not blow it out of proportion.

1207
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:20,666
Brother, pray to the
Demigod before leaving.

1208
01:08:20,916 --> 01:08:22,500
Good things will come your way.
- Okay.

1209
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:28,333
Alas! here comes the forest officer.

1210
01:08:28,333 --> 01:08:29,416
Bloody scoundrel!

1211
01:08:30,083 --> 01:08:32,625
Filling up the trenches marked,
doesn't make the forest theirs.

1212
01:08:32,625 --> 01:08:33,916
Let us wait and watch.

1213

Boom!

1214
01:08:41,458 --> 01:08:42,583
Working fine, right?

1215

Itʼs training time.

1217
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:49,541
Unlike others,
I don't miss my targets.

1218

Look at how evil the world is.

Nobody's as innocent as us.
- You're right.

Yes, Landlord.
It's easily 70 kilos.

You guys are freshers.
I used to hunt as a kid.

Oh! He doesn't look like a
hunter, does he?

1245

Take this! You may leave.

- Sure, Thimappa.

Are you avenging the past?

You are our forest officer,
why would we seek revenge from you?!

If ever I find you troubling
the department again,

1250

...I'll take you for a spin

Gotta take that ride, eh?

What should we do then?

1254
01:11:13,375 --> 01:11:15,333
Just shoot it.
- We'll at least get meat!

1255
01:11:15,375 --> 01:11:16,666
Shiva, donʼt say such things.

1256
01:11:16,708 --> 01:11:18,916
We have a record of the number
of animals in the forest.

1257
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:22,208
You better keep a tab on the
number of hunters amongst you.

your ancestral property?

01:12:29,791 --> 01:12:32,375

You'll get your hair back.

1282
01:12:47,875 --> 01:12:49,750
Is this enough?
- I don't want any, sir.

1283
01:12:49,958 --> 01:12:51,500
Have it. Itʼs okay.

1284
01:12:52,416 --> 01:12:53,458
Donʼt hesitate.

1285
01:13:01,375 --> 01:13:03,208
Sir, there wasnʼt enough water.
- Enough?

1286
01:13:03,416 --> 01:13:04,583
There wasnʼt any.

1287
01:13:07,083 --> 01:13:09,500
Sir, I need a favour from you.

1288
01:13:09,625 --> 01:13:10,708
One more peg?

1289
01:13:10,708 --> 01:13:11,875
Thatʼs not what I meant.

1290
01:13:12,458 --> 01:13:15,708

Landlord for my payment.

- What?

1294
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:26,291
Iʼll help you capture
Shiva and his mates.

1295
01:13:31,916 --> 01:13:35,583
Gurnal, what was Sundar saying
about doing good to the village?

1296
01:13:35,583 --> 01:13:37,375
He wants revenge because
the officer hit him.

1297
01:13:37,416 --> 01:13:38,833
He’s hot tempered.

1298
01:13:39,625 --> 01:13:41,000
What a huge tree!

1299
01:13:41,541 --> 01:13:43,541
Were you caught cutting
down a tree like this?

1300
01:13:43,583 --> 01:13:46,208
It was slightly
smaller than this.

1301
01:13:46,208 --> 01:13:47,583
No wonder you got whacked.

1302
01:13:47,625 --> 01:13:50,041
Donʼt finish it all.
Keep some for me too!

1303
01:13:50,583 --> 01:13:52,416
We will.
You continue cutting the tree.

1304
01:13:52,791 --> 01:13:54,458

1305
01:13:56,083 --> 01:13:57,833
Sir, please go slowly.

1306
01:13:58,333 --> 01:13:59,541

- Absolutely sir.

Those idiots have gained a lot of headweight
from killing eating all the forest animals.

1313

Let them taste food in jail.
That should teach them!

Bulla.
- Yes?

1315
01:14:20,375 --> 01:14:23,000

his job because of this tree.

1316
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,208
What if he doesnʼt?
- Letʼs do something bigger.

01:14:26,916 --> 01:14:28,250
Tiger skin. Cheetah.

1318
01:14:28,416 --> 01:14:30,166

- Nope.

1319
01:14:30,625 --> 01:14:32,250

we could have gone for the tusk.

died right there.

Have you lost it?

1333
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,484
It was not intentional.
- Who will believe you?

1334
01:16:36,525 --> 01:16:39,359
Everyone was aware of your
feud with the first officer!

1335
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,067
This will be considered
as a murder case!

1336
01:16:41,109 --> 01:16:42,109
What can we do now?

1337
01:16:45,692 --> 01:16:47,025
Iʼll handle this.

1338
01:16:47,067 --> 01:16:48,734
You know the forest well, Shiva.

1339
01:16:49,109 --> 01:16:52,067
Abscond for a while.

1340
01:16:58,025 --> 01:16:59,359
I gave them the signal.

1341
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:01,025
I thought they’d follow me.

1342
01:17:02,609 --> 01:17:03,609
Where is Shiva?

1343
01:17:06,734 --> 01:17:07,859
There's no one here.

1344
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:09,984
Have they left anything behind?
- Nope.

1345
01:17:10,692 --> 01:17:11,775
Then get down.

1346
01:17:13,692 --> 01:17:16,109
Because of us,
people in the jeep lost their lives.

1347
01:17:16,525 --> 01:17:17,525
Yes.

1348
01:17:17,567 --> 01:17:19,400

1349
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:23,192
If we get caught,
weʼll be behind bars.

1350
01:17:23,234 --> 01:17:24,317
You guys leave.

1351
01:17:25,025 --> 01:17:27,109

it was my fault.

01:17:29,859 --> 01:17:31,025
Bas*ard!

1354
01:17:31,442 --> 01:17:34,234
Instead of planning what to do next,
everyone’s worried about the dead!

1355
01:18:49,984 --> 01:18:51,859
If you come close to
me, I'll kill you.

1356
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:53,567
I'm a fierce warrior!

1357
01:18:54,275 --> 01:18:55,900

1359
01:18:59,650 --> 01:19:01,400
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

1360
01:19:01,692 --> 01:19:03,734
Sacrifice a hen to Guliga
and things will be fine.

1361
01:19:03,775 --> 01:19:06,109
Is Guliga so powerful?
- Of course.

1362
01:19:06,150 --> 01:19:07,817
Guliga is the one who
protects our borders.

1363
01:19:16,609 --> 01:19:17,775
What the hell dude?

1364
01:19:18,067 --> 01:19:19,359
Not a single human in sight!

1365
01:19:19,359 --> 01:19:20,400
Only cops.

1366
01:19:21,442 --> 01:19:23,400
Looks like they are
searching for someone.

1367
01:19:28,359 --> 01:19:30,067
Shiva! Itʼs over there.

1368
01:19:30,109 --> 01:19:31,109
Okay.

1369
01:19:34,317 --> 01:19:36,359
Itʼs not working! Sh*t!

1370
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:39,359
Landlord, itʼs me Shiva.

1371
01:19:45,192 --> 01:19:47,234
Thankfully,
everyone in the jeep survived.

1372
01:19:47,275 --> 01:19:48,400
We're saved!

1373
01:19:48,442 --> 01:19:50,942
We've to stay low in the forest
until further notice from Landlord.

1374
01:19:50,984 --> 01:19:52,400
Iʼll quickly go
and see my mother.

1375
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:53,775
The cops are around, Shiva.

1376
01:19:53,817 --> 01:19:54,942
If they come, give a signal.

1377
01:19:54,984 --> 01:19:56,150
To whom? To the Cops or you?

1378
01:19:56,150 --> 01:19:58,234
Signal your dead Grandpa!
- Go home. Get some gun powder, bombs.

1379
01:19:58,234 --> 01:19:59,484
We will need it for hunting.

1380
01:19:59,484 --> 01:20:01,442
Bulla, grab some eatables
from Padmaʼs shop.

1381
01:20:01,525 --> 01:20:03,692
Iʼll see you soon.
- Rampa come along.

1382
01:20:04,234 --> 01:20:05,484
Go inside and get everything.

1383
01:20:07,317 --> 01:20:08,317
Shiva?!

1384
01:20:08,650 --> 01:20:09,650
Shiva!

1385
01:20:09,859 --> 01:20:11,192
I'm done with these people.

1386
01:20:11,525 --> 01:20:13,567
I'll leave town right away.

1387
01:20:26,567 --> 01:20:27,984
No fish curry today?
Thatʼs enough.

1388
01:20:28,234 --> 01:20:30,400
For the sins you’ve
committed, I'm starving here.

1389
01:20:30,442 --> 01:20:31,609
He wants fish curry!

1390
01:20:31,650 --> 01:20:32,942
I can't swallow anything
without fish curry.

1391
01:20:32,942 --> 01:20:34,109
Make it the next time I come.

1392
01:20:34,150 --> 01:20:35,692
Youʼre going back again?

1393
01:20:35,734 --> 01:20:36,859
Iʼll be back soon mother.

1394
01:20:37,109 --> 01:20:38,359
Not like I'm joining the Army.

1395
01:20:41,692 --> 01:20:42,692
Give me a Soda.

1396
01:20:43,525 --> 01:20:44,525
Here.

1397
01:20:46,692 --> 01:20:48,275
Donʼt you have any change dude?

1398
01:20:52,817 --> 01:20:54,567
What an opportunity
at this hour!

1399
01:20:57,275 --> 01:20:58,275
A cop?

1400
01:20:58,984 --> 01:21:00,650
If I run away now,
will you come after me?

1401
01:21:01,192 --> 01:21:02,192
Chanchala!

1402
01:21:02,734 --> 01:21:04,192
Stop right there!

1403
01:21:05,234 --> 01:21:06,734
Sheela, I'm here.

1404
01:21:09,484 --> 01:21:11,484
You guys take your time
and enjoy your food.

1405
01:21:11,525 --> 01:21:13,109
Iʼll wait right outside.

1406
01:21:13,192 --> 01:21:14,567
Please have your dinner and go.

1407
01:21:14,942 --> 01:21:17,234
Don't make me run.
I can't run faster.

1408
01:21:17,734 --> 01:21:18,817
Shiva!

1409
01:21:18,859 --> 01:21:19,859
Look at him eat!

1410
01:21:19,859 --> 01:21:20,984
The cops are here. Run!

1411
01:21:21,317 --> 01:21:23,817
Mother, make fish curry.
I donʼt know when Iʼll come back!

1412
01:21:25,067 --> 01:21:26,359
Cover him from the other side.

1413
01:21:29,525 --> 01:21:31,150
Run guys!

1414
01:21:31,359 --> 01:21:33,609
Iʼll teach those
scoundrels a lesson!

1415
01:21:33,650 --> 01:21:34,734
Hey Abu!

1416
01:21:36,234 --> 01:21:37,359
Why did you throw it?

1417
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:39,150
If I light and don't throw
it, it'll explode in my hand!

1418
01:21:39,192 --> 01:21:40,650
You're going to get us killed.
Run!

1419
01:21:41,942 --> 01:21:44,067
This is what happens when
you show up at work drunk!

1420
01:21:44,067 --> 01:21:45,192
Are you crazy?

1421
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:48,359
Sir, we didnʼt
collide with the tree.

1422
01:21:48,484 --> 01:21:50,067
The tree fell on us.

1423
01:21:50,192 --> 01:21:51,900
We didnʼt even
realise what happened.

1424
01:21:51,942 --> 01:21:52,942
Shut up!

1425
01:21:52,942 --> 01:21:55,525
You better stay away from people
like him and focus on work.

1426
01:21:58,359 --> 01:21:59,775
This is all Shivaʼs handiwork.

1427
01:21:59,775 --> 01:22:01,067
This was intentional.

1428
01:22:02,234 --> 01:22:05,109
Ravi, file all the
possible cases on him.

1429
01:22:05,650 --> 01:22:06,984
He should never see daylight.

1430
01:22:31,025 --> 01:22:32,025
Do you hear it too?

1431
01:22:35,484 --> 01:22:36,484
Yes.

1432
01:22:38,775 --> 01:22:40,025
Get up man!

1433
01:22:42,067 --> 01:22:43,067
Hey cops!

1434
01:22:43,067 --> 01:22:44,484
Itʼs a raid! Run!

1435
01:22:44,525 --> 01:22:46,067
Hey Rampanna!

1436
01:22:50,650 --> 01:22:52,650
Leela, the aroma is brilliant!

1437
01:22:53,609 --> 01:22:56,025
Are you dumb?
Why did you bring a stranger here?

1438
01:22:56,025 --> 01:22:59,859
Look at these street mongrels
hogging from a stranger.

1439
01:23:00,067 --> 01:23:01,150
Donʼt eat it idiots!

1440
01:23:05,359 --> 01:23:07,400
You should be lucky
to eat such food.

1441
01:23:07,442 --> 01:23:10,150
Bullsh*t!
My mother cooks better.

1442
01:23:10,192 --> 01:23:11,192
Shiva!

1443
01:23:13,942 --> 01:23:15,275
What a bunch of cowards!

1444
01:23:15,734 --> 01:23:17,900
I ran for my life
and none of you followed me.

1445
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:19,400
We called you many times.

1446
01:23:19,442 --> 01:23:21,234
But you were too
scared to hear us.

1447
01:23:21,484 --> 01:23:23,609
Leela, have you come alone?

1448
01:23:23,650 --> 01:23:25,984
The next time you come,
please leave your anklets at home.

1449
01:23:26,525 --> 01:23:28,317
Did you all finish eating?

1450
01:23:28,359 --> 01:23:29,359
I didnʼt.

1451
01:23:30,150 --> 01:23:31,775
A man must be stubborn.
- Correct!

1452
01:23:31,775 --> 01:23:32,775
You carry on with it.

1453
01:23:32,817 --> 01:23:34,484
Bulla, hope you’ve left some for me.

1454
01:23:34,525 --> 01:23:35,609
Have it.

1455
01:23:35,609 --> 01:23:37,400
It's okay to be stubborn.
Not arrogant!

1456
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:39,859
Done serving? Take her away.

1457
01:23:40,234 --> 01:23:41,609
Else Iʼll beat her to death!

1458
01:23:41,609 --> 01:23:43,817
Of course!
Killing people is all you know.

1459
01:23:43,817 --> 01:23:46,567
As if the tree incident, wasnʼt enough,
you’ve thrown bombs on the cops!

1460
01:23:46,609 --> 01:23:48,484
They’re searching for you
in the entire village.

1461
01:23:48,525 --> 01:23:50,442
In no time,
they will arrive here.

1462
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:51,984
Just go to hell!

1463
01:23:52,234 --> 01:23:53,900
Enough eating!
Give it back!

1464
01:23:54,192 --> 01:23:55,442
Lacchu, come.

1465
01:23:56,192 --> 01:23:58,067
There was a big
piece of fish left.

1466
01:23:58,692 --> 01:24:01,317
She's the one who fenced her
own village on Day 1 of her job.

1467
01:24:01,317 --> 01:24:03,817
I donʼt trust she was
here to just give us food.

1468
01:24:11,525 --> 01:24:12,525
Hey Shiva!

1469
01:24:13,817 --> 01:24:15,567
He went off with my gun!

1470
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:28,400
You may come inside,
instead of sitting like a guard outside.

1471
01:24:36,859 --> 01:24:38,734
We didn't intentionally
drop the tree on them.

1472
01:24:38,775 --> 01:24:39,859
It was an accident.

1473
01:24:40,442 --> 01:24:42,192
You think I did
things intentionally?

1474
01:24:42,192 --> 01:24:46,317
Though I wasn't at fault in the encroachment
case, you guys treated me like a dog.

1475
01:24:46,359 --> 01:24:48,359
Do you want a job that goes
against your own people?

1476
01:24:48,359 --> 01:24:49,525
Okay, Iʼll quit.

1477
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:52,692
All my efforts to procure
the job will go in vain.

1478
01:24:53,234 --> 01:24:55,734
If it makes you
happy, Iʼll quit.

1479
01:25:06,275 --> 01:25:07,275
Iʼm sorry.

1480
01:25:07,609 --> 01:25:08,942
No need to put up an act.

1481
01:25:09,567 --> 01:25:10,984
Don't you see I'm apologising?

1482
01:25:11,025 --> 01:25:12,567
To hell with your apology.

1483
01:25:14,442 --> 01:25:16,109
Acting smart when I say sorry?

1484
01:25:16,150 --> 01:25:17,150
No Shiva.

1485
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:18,400
What?

1486
01:25:18,817 --> 01:25:19,817
No, Shiva.

1487
01:25:22,025 --> 01:25:23,025
What don't you want?

1488
01:25:30,567 --> 01:25:31,650
You stink of beedis.

1489
01:25:32,192 --> 01:25:33,192
Doesn't bother me.

1490
01:25:35,650 --> 01:25:37,650
Remind me to offer
a hen to Guliga.

1491
01:25:37,692 --> 01:25:38,692
Alright.

1492
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:48,192
Hey Leela!
Why didnʼt you lock the door?

1493
01:25:48,234 --> 01:25:49,775
What if something
dangerous enters home?

1494
01:25:53,234 --> 01:25:54,942
Shivanna?
- Hmm?

1495
01:25:56,317 --> 01:25:57,484
Where were you all this time?

1496
01:25:57,525 --> 01:25:58,525
I was in the forest.

1497
01:25:58,734 --> 01:26:00,942
I felt like seeing you all.
So, I came by.

1498
01:26:01,484 --> 01:26:05,025
Shivanna, in our house,
we use only grated coconut to cook.

1499
01:26:05,025 --> 01:26:06,359
Not the shell.

1500
01:26:10,234 --> 01:26:11,275
Have you eaten?

1501
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:13,400
Shall we?

1502
01:26:14,442 --> 01:26:15,442
Come.

1503
01:26:16,275 --> 01:26:17,400
Shall we eat?

1504
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:21,234
Dinner was good.
- I don't know who got the fish.

1505
01:26:21,275 --> 01:26:22,650
Howʼs my husband?

1506
01:26:23,234 --> 01:26:24,234
Heʼs fine.

1507
01:26:24,609 --> 01:26:26,817
You should have brought him too.

1508
01:26:27,692 --> 01:26:29,567
He didnʼt know I was coming.

1509
01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:34,192
Shivanna, leaving already?

1510
01:26:39,859 --> 01:26:42,442
Yes. I will be in
Kailasa for some time.

1511
01:26:42,442 --> 01:26:44,567
Go in. Have your dinner, kids.

1512
01:26:58,567 --> 01:26:59,942
Who told you to come here?

1513
01:27:00,192 --> 01:27:01,817
You could've left
without speaking a word.

1514
01:27:02,234 --> 01:27:04,400
Who were you trying to
inform about Kailasa?

1515
01:27:06,817 --> 01:27:07,817
I was telling you.

1516
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:13,734
What are you thinking, Shiva?

1517
01:27:14,234 --> 01:27:15,400
I'll surrender.

1518
01:27:16,442 --> 01:27:17,442
Don't Shiva.

1519
01:27:18,192 --> 01:27:23,900
In a situation like this, they'll file random
cases and make sure you never get out of jail.

1520
01:27:28,442 --> 01:27:29,442
That's okay.

1521
01:27:30,275 --> 01:27:31,817
None of you should
suffer because of me.

1522
01:27:32,525 --> 01:27:33,525
Let’s see what happens.

1523
01:27:33,525 --> 01:27:34,609
Shiva!

1524
01:27:40,984 --> 01:27:42,359
It's dawn already. Leave now.

1525
01:27:43,150 --> 01:27:44,150
Go.

1526
01:27:50,984 --> 01:27:51,984
Hello! Good morning!

1527
01:27:54,650 --> 01:27:56,442
Shiva and Leela in Kailasa!

1528
01:27:57,067 --> 01:27:58,442
I had come up a while ago.

1529
01:27:59,359 --> 01:28:02,067
But I didnʼt want to disturb
since you were asleep.

1530
01:28:03,734 --> 01:28:06,817
The enthusiasm you had while climbing,
seems to be missing while getting down!

1531
01:28:10,442 --> 01:28:11,442
Off with you!

1532
01:28:15,109 --> 01:28:18,234
The Government pays your salary,
but you're serving him, eh?

1533
01:28:19,692 --> 01:28:20,692
You leave.

1534
01:28:22,025 --> 01:28:23,400
Donʼt you get it? Go!

1535
01:28:25,817 --> 01:28:27,109
I will handle these morons.

1536
01:28:30,192 --> 01:28:32,234
Why are you butting
in when we're talking?

1537
01:28:32,275 --> 01:28:33,484
Move aside!

1538
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:46,817
We sure canʼt award
you for your co-operation.

1539
01:28:47,234 --> 01:28:48,317
But I can suspend you.

1540
01:28:49,650 --> 01:28:50,650
Isn’t it Shiva?

1541
01:28:51,734 --> 01:28:52,775
Is it loaded?
- Yes.

1542
01:28:54,109 --> 01:28:56,109
You have to serve
Shiva in his Kailasa.

1543
01:28:57,275 --> 01:29:00,067
You also have to take care of
the Landlord who got you the job.

1544
01:29:01,025 --> 01:29:02,484
Sir!
- Poor girl. Must be tired.

1545
01:29:03,025 --> 01:29:05,317
Rest for some 15 days.
Okay?

1546
01:29:06,609 --> 01:29:08,067
Will you hold a
torch for this too?

1547
01:29:08,817 --> 01:29:10,900
Itʼs Shivaʼs gun.
It's loaded sir!

1548
01:29:11,984 --> 01:29:12,984
Come forward!

1549
01:29:15,192 --> 01:29:16,192
Come.

1550
01:29:23,817 --> 01:29:24,859
Sir!

1551
01:29:26,484 --> 01:29:27,984
Move aside.

1552
01:29:31,234 --> 01:29:32,817
Where are you taking him?

1553
01:29:34,734 --> 01:29:35,734
I said move aside.

[INDISTINCT COMMOTION]

1555
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:07,734
Shiva,
what happened to your face?

1556
01:30:07,775 --> 01:30:09,150
Forget that.
How did they catch you?

1557
01:30:09,192 --> 01:30:12,150
This bonehead went for a girl
but returned with the cops.

1558
01:30:12,150 --> 01:30:13,192
Moron!

1559
01:30:13,650 --> 01:30:15,442
Sorry.
- Pervert!

- Where were you?

1562
01:30:20,150 --> 01:30:21,234
Thought so.

1563
01:30:21,275 --> 01:30:23,859
As if you're
extremely responsible!

1564
01:30:26,692 --> 01:30:28,484
I had told him not
to leave his hideout.

1565
01:30:28,859 --> 01:30:29,984
His bad luck.

1566
01:30:32,067 --> 01:30:33,192
Good thing.

1567
01:30:33,984 --> 01:30:35,192
He was flying high.

1568
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:37,400
Please donʼt bail him out.

I won't be at peace, Sudhakar.

You must set things
right Landlord.

1574

hour to tell me this?

1575
01:31:15,609 --> 01:31:18,359
Donʼt worry Guruva.
Iʼll take care of it.

1576
01:31:20,692 --> 01:31:21,984
What did he say?

1577
01:31:22,609 --> 01:31:24,275
He wants me to set things right.

1578
01:31:25,525 --> 01:31:28,692

- That's a different section.

1586

Hope everything's fine.

Looks like she is still
angry with my family.

Nothing of that sort.

gratitude for that work.

If we take a right and go straight
from there, is the bathing area.

1654

Now is not the time to bathe.

1655
01:35:56,942 --> 01:35:58,359

You go on.

1656

youʼll find the toilet.

he'll take to be done.

1658
01:36:04,525 --> 01:36:05,984
Shut up! Go on.

1659
01:36:05,984 --> 01:36:07,567
Thereʼs an alley next to it.

1660
01:36:07,984 --> 01:36:12,025
If we go straight,
thereʼs a 15-foot wall.

1661
01:36:12,859 --> 01:36:15,650
Each of us is at
least five foot tall.

1662
01:36:15,692 --> 01:36:16,817
I'm 5.5ft tall.

1663
01:36:16,817 --> 01:36:20,275
If we get up on each other, we'll be
able to jump over to the other side.

1664
01:36:20,317 --> 01:36:21,775
Freedom! Howʼs the idea?

1665
01:36:23,359 --> 01:36:24,359
Well done.

1666
01:36:24,775 --> 01:36:26,442
Who will be the last man standing?
You?

1667
01:36:26,484 --> 01:36:27,817
Why not? Iʼm six feet tall.

1668
01:36:27,817 --> 01:36:28,817
How will you jump?

1669
01:36:32,234 --> 01:36:36,442
Canʼt you come back and open
the gate after youʼve jumped?

1670
01:36:36,484 --> 01:36:38,859
Like you're father's waiting
to get you out! Dimwit!

1671
01:36:39,150 --> 01:36:41,109
I donʼt think you
understood what I said.

1672
01:36:41,150 --> 01:36:42,525
Let me explain again.
- Damn you!

1673
01:36:42,525 --> 01:36:43,734
This is where we are.

1674

Let's skip this
Prison break idea.

1675
01:36:45,192 --> 01:36:47,192
Let's take the legal route.
We'll be fine.

you're bluffing with?

1703
01:40:41,442 --> 01:40:42,734
He had no enemies.

1704
01:40:44,025 --> 01:40:45,150
Who dared to do this?

1705
01:40:45,150 --> 01:40:48,859
Whoever it is,
the Demigod will not spare him.

1706
01:40:49,442 --> 01:40:51,734
He will die vomiting blood.

1707
01:40:52,525 --> 01:40:54,067
Did you lodge a
complaint with the cops?

1708
01:40:54,109 --> 01:40:56,484
I asked to.
But theyʼre not willing to.

1709
01:40:57,359 --> 01:40:59,109
Why?
- He had the soul of the demi god.

1710
01:40:59,150 --> 01:41:02,067
Does it seem right to slash that body
under the pretext of a post-mortem?

1711
01:41:02,067 --> 01:41:03,400
It wonʼt just be that.

1712
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:06,400
They will separate the soul
and the body and give it to us.

1713
01:41:06,442 --> 01:41:08,317
That body has experienced
enough pain already.

1714
01:41:08,775 --> 01:41:10,567
Letʼs not lodge a complaint.

1715
01:41:11,359 --> 01:41:13,150
At least,
let his soul rest in peace.

1716
01:41:13,442 --> 01:41:15,067
Letʼs inform Shiva.

1717
01:41:15,109 --> 01:41:17,942
If we tell him,
the cops will accompany him here.

1718

01:41:25,025 --> 01:41:27,067
A man who served the
Demigod drops dead.

1722
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:28,567
What is happening here?!

1723
01:41:28,567 --> 01:41:30,025
Is this land cursed?

1724
01:41:30,150 --> 01:41:31,775
The curse can be removed.

1725
01:41:32,817 --> 01:41:37,150
By the time the mourning period is over,
I will destroy whoever killed Guruva.

1726
01:41:37,692 --> 01:41:39,025
All the village attendees!

1727
01:41:39,025 --> 01:41:42,234
The one who was serving the Demigod
has left to the feet of Lord Guru.

1728
01:41:42,234 --> 01:41:45,150
Until the another person is
appointed as the next monarch....

1729
01:41:45,150 --> 01:41:48,150
I shall now take out the
Guruva's symbolic attire.

1730
01:41:51,859 --> 01:41:56,609
♪ O'! An injured womb is a painful fate ♪

1731
01:41:56,900 --> 01:42:01,734
♪ Yet you wander all your
life to find a cure ♪

1732
01:42:02,484 --> 01:42:06,275
♪ In a conflict with
an invisible opponent ♪

1733

1736
01:42:45,317 --> 01:42:47,025
Kamala!
All of you are here to see me.

1737
01:42:47,609 --> 01:42:48,609
How are you?

1738
01:42:48,609 --> 01:42:49,609
Iʼm fine!

1739
01:42:49,942 --> 01:42:51,192
How are you all doing?

1740
01:42:52,650 --> 01:42:54,150
Did you go hunting?

1741
01:42:55,234 --> 01:42:56,234
How are you dear?

1742
01:42:57,025 --> 01:42:59,400
Kamala, buy her an ice-candy.

1743
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:00,859
Sheʼs sobbing all the time!

1744
01:43:00,984 --> 01:43:03,150
I don't want you to
perform Bhoota Kola.

1745
01:43:03,150 --> 01:43:04,150
What?

1746
01:43:06,442 --> 01:43:08,609
What the hell man!
Why are you talking so strangely?

1747
01:43:12,650 --> 01:43:13,817
Whatʼs the matter?

1748
01:43:14,650 --> 01:43:15,984
Why should I perform
Bhootha Kola?

1749
01:43:16,234 --> 01:43:17,400
Guruva is doing it anyway.

1750
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:21,900
He's doing it, right?

1751
01:43:22,275 --> 01:43:24,525
You will not perform the Kola.
Ever.

1752
01:43:36,692 --> 01:43:39,525
What happened?
- Guruva was stabbed to death.

1753
01:43:41,317 --> 01:43:44,900
They threw his corpse in a
jeep near the Kola arena.

1754
01:43:50,817 --> 01:43:51,817
Shiva!

1755
01:43:51,942 --> 01:43:52,942
Hey Shiva!

1756
01:44:21,942 --> 01:44:26,109
Murali, just 'cause the documents were
submitted, the encroachment issue won't end.

1757
01:44:26,150 --> 01:44:29,150
If the villagers donʼt support
you, the fight will continue.

1758
01:44:29,900 --> 01:44:32,109
It's not easy to convert a
forest into a reserve forest.

1759
01:44:32,317 --> 01:44:33,817
Drop your ego and work.

1760
01:44:36,984 --> 01:44:40,275
Sir, people of Kaadubettu
have replied through court.

1761
01:44:40,275 --> 01:44:42,275
Looks like your villagers
finally found the time.

1762
01:44:42,567 --> 01:44:45,484
People feel the heat only
when their as* is on fire.

1763
01:44:50,484 --> 01:44:52,025
Raghu, get the jeep.
- Why sir?

1764
01:44:52,442 --> 01:44:54,900
The scoundrel Landlord has
replied to the encroachment issue.

1765
01:44:54,900 --> 01:44:56,567
Devendra Suttur?
How is that possible?

1766
01:44:56,734 --> 01:44:58,692
Arenʼt the land owners
supposed to reply?

1767
01:44:58,859 --> 01:45:01,067
Letʼs find out.
- It's all over.

1768
01:45:01,109 --> 01:45:03,484
All the land has been transferred
to the Landlord's name.

1769
01:45:04,150 --> 01:45:06,067
All the documents
are now in his name.

1770
01:45:06,775 --> 01:45:08,025
Take care of the file.

1771
01:45:09,359 --> 01:45:13,400
Every time there has been survey,
that shmuck has claimed twenty acres more!

1772
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:16,734
Thatʼs how his ancestors
have always been.

1773
01:45:16,859 --> 01:45:19,275
But we are not like that.

1774
01:45:19,275 --> 01:45:20,609
We have retained
the same measure.

1775
01:45:23,109 --> 01:45:24,442
Get the area map.

1776
01:45:24,900 --> 01:45:25,900
Whatʼs this?

1777
01:45:25,900 --> 01:45:27,900
I have to tell you something.
- What?

1778
01:45:27,942 --> 01:45:31,859
At one point of time, a fight broke out
putting an end to the Kola procession.

1779
01:45:32,067 --> 01:45:35,525
My family took over the rituals
again and we were taking care of it.

1780
01:45:35,567 --> 01:45:37,984
What if he gets out on bail?
- He won't.

1781
01:45:38,567 --> 01:45:40,109
No way.
- Really?

1782
01:45:40,317 --> 01:45:43,817
Only if he gets a great
lawyer, he might.

1783
01:45:43,942 --> 01:45:46,359
[ON CALL] Does that scammer
Devendra own so much land?

1784
01:45:48,484 --> 01:45:50,359
Ay! Thatʼs the area map.

1785
01:45:50,650 --> 01:45:51,984
A map?

1786
01:45:53,192 --> 01:45:54,734
Of what use is it now?

1787
01:45:54,734 --> 01:45:56,609
People have already
written off their land!

1788
01:45:56,984 --> 01:46:00,734
All documents required to convert
Kaadubettu into a reserve forest are ready.

1789
01:46:01,442 --> 01:46:05,484
If this file moves, the Landlord's
documents will become null and void.

1790
01:46:05,942 --> 01:46:09,400
Your Landlord will have to bow
down before the Lord in the Courts.

1791
01:46:09,442 --> 01:46:10,859
Do as you wish.

1792
01:46:10,900 --> 01:46:13,984
This Bhandara mansion's
Rajeeva is always with you.

1793
01:46:15,192 --> 01:46:16,775
Shiva should have
been with us now.

1794
01:46:24,359 --> 01:46:26,359
Bail out Shiva soon.

1795
01:46:26,442 --> 01:46:29,484
Wow! Change of mind so soon?

1796
01:46:29,525 --> 01:46:31,900
Didnʼt you say a while
ago not to bail him out?

1797
01:46:31,942 --> 01:46:34,025
Iʼm the one telling you
now to bail him out.

1798
01:46:35,275 --> 01:46:39,150
Is it some chicken coop to
open and release it so quickly?

1799
01:46:39,525 --> 01:46:40,775
Itʼs a prison!

1800
01:46:41,275 --> 01:46:42,775
Are you high?

1801
01:46:43,234 --> 01:46:44,942
Can you do it or not?

1802
01:46:44,942 --> 01:46:45,942
I can.

1803
01:46:46,442 --> 01:46:48,109
But itʼs a little tough.

1804
01:46:48,859 --> 01:46:50,817
If we spend some money, we can.

1805
01:46:50,859 --> 01:46:53,775
Iʼll speak to Subba Rao.

1806
01:47:17,234 --> 01:47:18,234
Hello?

1807
01:47:23,317 --> 01:47:26,484
Once upon a time,
there lived a king.

1808
01:47:26,942 --> 01:47:27,942
Just like you.

1809
01:47:30,025 --> 01:47:37,984
From then on, for generations,
everyone kept worshipping the stone.

1810
01:47:38,775 --> 01:47:43,775
From then on, for generations,
everyone kept worshipping the stone.

1811
01:47:44,067 --> 01:47:48,067
When one generation
decided to reclaim the land...

1812
01:47:50,442 --> 01:47:52,942
Instead of shutting their traps
and taking the land back...

1813
01:47:53,525 --> 01:47:55,359
They decided to ask
the Demigod about it.

1814
01:47:55,734 --> 01:47:57,109
The Demigod...

1815
01:47:57,525 --> 01:47:58,942
Wait. No!

1816
01:48:00,525 --> 01:48:02,734
The one wearing the
Demigod's costume...

1817
01:48:04,234 --> 01:48:08,567
The performer told the Landlord that if he messed
with the land, he would die vomiting blood.

1818
01:48:08,984 --> 01:48:12,984
The Landlord realized that
it was the performer talking.

1819
01:48:13,359 --> 01:48:16,650
Is this the Demigod speaking?
Or is it the performer?

1820
01:48:16,650 --> 01:48:20,234
The performer who was caught
red-handed ran away in shame.

1821
01:48:22,317 --> 01:48:23,650
What happened after that?

1822
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:27,984
Then the Landlord
died of old age.

1823
01:48:28,317 --> 01:48:32,692
The Landlordʼs son in the hope that
at least he could reclaim the land...

1824
01:48:32,734 --> 01:48:34,234
Come on! Let me drop you.

1825
01:48:35,609 --> 01:48:36,734
How can I help you Landlord?

1826
01:48:36,775 --> 01:48:37,775
Guruva.

1827
01:48:38,192 --> 01:48:39,817
I will give you some of my land.

1828
01:48:40,567 --> 01:48:43,150
In return, you must ensure I get
back the land I own in your village.

1829
01:48:43,150 --> 01:48:44,650
How is it possible, Landlord?

1830
01:48:44,650 --> 01:48:48,150
Eons ago, when the Demigod claimed the
land, it was given to the villagers.

1831
01:48:48,650 --> 01:48:52,942
From now on, Guruva must speak at the
Bhootha Kola instead of the Demigod.

1832
01:48:52,942 --> 01:48:54,692
Why are you talking like
this, Landlord?

1833
01:48:54,692 --> 01:48:57,109
Once we don the finery,
it it is the Demigod that takes over.

1834
01:48:57,109 --> 01:48:58,275
Nothing is in my hand

1835
01:48:58,650 --> 01:49:01,234
The Demigod appears
only once a while.

1836
01:49:01,650 --> 01:49:03,900
The rest of the time,
isnʼt it Guruva who speaks?

1837
01:49:07,775 --> 01:49:11,192
To satisfy your greed,
I can't speak as you desire.

1838
01:49:12,317 --> 01:49:13,817
The Demigod will
not appreciate this.

1839
01:49:15,317 --> 01:49:18,317
Itʼs not wrong to reclaim our
land, right?

1840
01:49:22,067 --> 01:49:23,067
Landlord!

1841
01:49:27,775 --> 01:49:30,317
What have you achieved by gaining
the Demigod's appreciation?

1842
01:49:35,900 --> 01:49:37,942
I canʼt believe
youʼre saying this.

1843
01:49:40,234 --> 01:49:41,984
The villagers have a
lot of respect for you.

1844
01:49:44,609 --> 01:49:45,650
If they get to know...

1845
01:49:50,275 --> 01:49:51,442
How will they know?

1846
01:49:52,067 --> 01:49:53,067
Will you tell them?

1847
01:49:53,650 --> 01:49:54,859
Will you?

1848
01:49:55,984 --> 01:49:56,984
Oh!

1849
01:49:58,192 --> 01:49:59,192
The Demigod will?

1850
01:50:01,192 --> 01:50:02,275
The Demigod might, right?

1851
01:50:02,317 --> 01:50:08,525
For the sake of that land, he dealt with the man
who was cheating us in the name of a stone.

1852
01:50:16,025 --> 01:50:18,359
Do you even know the
value of 100 acres?

1853
01:50:18,359 --> 01:50:21,317
You got it for free.
How will you know itʼs value?

1854
01:50:26,275 --> 01:50:28,609
I asked you to set things
right, Landlord.

1855
01:50:31,400 --> 01:50:33,234
I donʼt think you
realise what you've done.

1856
01:50:33,359 --> 01:50:36,109
If I need to set things right,
what is the use of your Demigod?

1857
01:50:37,817 --> 01:50:39,775
From now on,
Iʼll speak on behalf of the Demigod.

1858
01:50:46,900 --> 01:50:49,192
Then?
- It was a blunder.

1859
01:50:49,609 --> 01:50:51,567
Letʼs dispose his
body over there.

1860
01:50:53,525 --> 01:50:55,859
When there is plenty of
space in the forest...

1861
01:50:56,817 --> 01:50:58,359
Why are you keen on
disposing it there?

1862
01:50:58,359 --> 01:50:59,567
I have to.

1863
01:51:00,025 --> 01:51:03,025
For those fools who are
freeloading on my land for years...

1864
01:51:03,442 --> 01:51:05,359
This will serve as a warning.

1865
01:51:16,067 --> 01:51:17,650
After that?

1866
01:51:17,775 --> 01:51:19,775
Let's find out what lies next.

1867
01:51:19,900 --> 01:51:20,900
Okay?

1868
01:51:33,900 --> 01:51:36,484
People will respect us more when
we walk out of the prison, right?

1869
01:51:36,525 --> 01:51:38,692
We went in because
of your stupid gun!

1870
01:51:40,942 --> 01:51:42,525
Didnʼt you bring the axe, boy?
- No.

1871
01:51:42,984 --> 01:51:43,984
You should have.

1872
01:51:46,109 --> 01:51:47,442
Youʼve lost so much hair.

1873
01:51:47,859 --> 01:51:49,275
There is a plant in the forest…

1874
01:51:49,275 --> 01:51:53,109
A plant? Shove it up your…!

1875
01:51:53,525 --> 01:51:54,859
Any updates on Guruvaʼs death?

1876
01:51:56,525 --> 01:51:57,984
He got you out on bail.

1877
01:51:59,984 --> 01:52:01,192
Thank you.

1878
01:52:01,234 --> 01:52:02,484
I have to speak to you, Shiva.

1879
01:52:02,900 --> 01:52:05,900
Shiva, the Landlord
has called you home.

1880
01:52:05,942 --> 01:52:07,984
You donʼt have to go anywhere.
Come home.

1881
01:52:08,442 --> 01:52:09,442
Give me the key.

1882
01:52:09,734 --> 01:52:10,775
You guys come in the jeep.

1883
01:52:10,942 --> 01:52:13,275
Back to your old ways, you dog!

1884
01:52:13,275 --> 01:52:14,650
It was a mistake to get you bail!

1885
01:52:14,650 --> 01:52:17,692
Where are you off
to now scoundrel?

1886
01:52:20,817 --> 01:52:22,150
Shiva!

1887
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:25,442
Shiva?

1888
01:52:30,442 --> 01:52:34,150
Shiva! Itʼs been so
long since I saw you!

1889
01:52:34,484 --> 01:52:37,525
Come. Hope things were fine in the prison.
- Yes.

1890
01:52:38,442 --> 01:52:40,025
I heard Rajeev bailed you out.

1891
01:52:40,067 --> 01:52:41,525
To get close to you I guess!

1892
01:52:42,567 --> 01:52:43,859
His family is known for it.

1893
01:52:43,900 --> 01:52:48,109
When the Bhootha Kola stopped, he took
the Demigod's ornaments to his house!

1894
01:52:48,150 --> 01:52:49,359
I have to speak to you.

1895
01:52:49,359 --> 01:52:51,192
So do I!

1896
01:52:51,234 --> 01:52:53,567
But first, let us party!

1897
01:52:55,317 --> 01:52:58,234
The Landlord always has scotch.
- What about Guddi?

1898
01:52:58,525 --> 01:52:59,817
Guddi drinks Landlord's scotch.

1899
01:52:59,817 --> 01:53:01,650
Heʼs drinking away to glory!

1900
01:53:02,442 --> 01:53:04,567
He doesnʼt get high easily.

1901
01:53:05,317 --> 01:53:06,609
Thatʼs why I gave him scotch.

1902
01:53:07,484 --> 01:53:09,359
He says youʼre high.

1903
01:53:09,859 --> 01:53:11,025
No Landlord.

1904
01:53:11,817 --> 01:53:13,734
I drink in buckets.

1905
01:53:14,359 --> 01:53:15,484
This is nothing.

1906
01:53:24,192 --> 01:53:25,734
I have something to ask you.

1907
01:53:25,775 --> 01:53:26,775
Go on.

1908
01:53:29,275 --> 01:53:33,109
Who killed our Guruva?

1909
01:53:34,609 --> 01:53:35,609
Why?

1910
01:53:37,150 --> 01:53:38,150
You!

1911
01:53:39,400 --> 01:53:40,400
You!

1912
01:53:41,525 --> 01:53:42,734
You should be with us.

1913
01:53:47,109 --> 01:53:50,109
No matter who he is,
I will not spare him!

1914
01:53:50,984 --> 01:53:52,109
Iʼll kill him!

1915
01:53:52,567 --> 01:53:53,609
Are you done?

1916
01:53:54,817 --> 01:53:55,942
Send them out.

1917
01:53:55,942 --> 01:53:57,234
Letʼs speak in private.

1918
01:53:58,442 --> 01:54:00,609
You guys carry on.
Iʼll come later.

1919
01:54:00,817 --> 01:54:03,025
Landlord,
your crotch was superb.

1920
01:54:03,025 --> 01:54:05,400
Not his crotch you idiot.
His Scotch!

1921
01:54:09,859 --> 01:54:11,234
Devendra Suttur.

1922
01:54:11,484 --> 01:54:12,775
I'm a Landlord only for namesake.

1923
01:54:13,109 --> 01:54:15,234
But I couldnʼt serve my people.

1924
01:54:15,359 --> 01:54:16,650
Then why do I deserve
the title of a Landlord?

1925
01:54:16,692 --> 01:54:18,275
Why are you speaking
like this Landlord?

1926
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:19,609
Whatʼs wrong with you?

1927
01:54:19,859 --> 01:54:24,109
I had a big task ahead of me
before you were released from jail.

1928
01:54:24,650 --> 01:54:27,067
Rajeeva got you released before that.
- Iʼm not following you.

1929
01:54:27,067 --> 01:54:28,192
Let me tell you this.

1930
01:54:29,067 --> 01:54:30,442
Donʼt lose control.

1931
01:54:30,484 --> 01:54:31,859
You've to listen patiently.

1932
01:54:33,442 --> 01:54:35,692
Do you know who
killed our Guruva?

1933
01:54:36,192 --> 01:54:38,359
Who?
- That son of a bi*ch DRFO!

1934
01:54:40,275 --> 01:54:41,900
He tried to stop
our Bhootha Kola.

1935
01:54:42,150 --> 01:54:44,317
When that wasnʼt possible,
he killed the performer.

1936
01:54:44,775 --> 01:54:47,859
He came in a jeep and threw the corpse
in the Demigod's performing arena.

1937
01:54:48,192 --> 01:54:50,234
Do you know how he was killed?

1938
01:54:51,192 --> 01:54:52,192
Shiva!

1939
01:54:52,609 --> 01:54:54,192
Didnʼt I tell you earlier?

1940
01:54:54,567 --> 01:54:55,984
You have to be patient.

1941
01:54:56,025 --> 01:54:59,317
Listen to me Shiva!
Donʼt act in haste. Okay?

1942
01:54:59,359 --> 01:55:00,400
Listen to me.

1943
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:03,984
Whatever needs to be done to him,
Iʼll do it with my own hands.

1944
01:55:04,567 --> 01:55:06,817
This land will be
cleansed with his blood!

1945
01:55:08,609 --> 01:55:10,150
He killed my brother.

1946
01:55:10,859 --> 01:55:12,317
Why do you want
blood on your hands?

1947
01:55:12,692 --> 01:55:15,775
Shiva, listen to me!
Donʼt act in haste!!

1948
01:55:16,067 --> 01:55:17,067
Shiva!

1949
01:55:23,400 --> 01:55:25,984
Sudhakar, give me some water.

1950
01:55:26,359 --> 01:55:27,525
I just touched a rabid dog.

1951
01:55:33,900 --> 01:55:35,567
The tiger is off to hunt.

1952
01:55:35,817 --> 01:55:37,984
Once it finishes hunting,
lock it up in a cage.

1953
01:55:43,192 --> 01:55:46,317
Instead of killing the Forest officer,
why's he at Mahadevachari's workshop?

1954
01:55:49,900 --> 01:55:50,900
Mahadevanna..

1955
01:55:50,942 --> 01:55:53,817
Before dawn sets in,
I'll finish those who killed Guruva.

1956
01:56:07,150 --> 01:56:12,734
Darkness exists to give a
man's mind and body some peace.

1957
01:56:13,109 --> 01:56:14,567
Not to destroy it.

1958
01:56:14,609 --> 01:56:16,650
But it has been destroyed,
hasn't it Mahadevanna?

1959
01:56:17,025 --> 01:56:18,567
That son of a bi*ch DRFO!

1960
01:56:20,317 --> 01:56:21,650
Can the destroyer be spared?

1961
01:56:23,359 --> 01:56:25,150
Iʼm tugging at this for courage.
- Courage?

1962
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:29,900
Courage comes from
the fire within you.

1963
01:56:31,150 --> 01:56:35,942
Let the fire within you
not end up burning you.

1964
01:56:39,359 --> 01:56:42,775
I donʼt know if it's your words or if
it's the stuff that is hitting me hard.

1965
01:56:44,734 --> 01:56:50,692
Your words are
passing over my head.

1966
01:56:50,692 --> 01:56:52,359
It is passing by.

1967
01:56:53,942 --> 01:56:57,317
The Landlord is taking Guruva
and is passing by in his jeep.

1968
01:56:58,567 --> 01:57:04,359
While returning,
the Landlord is passing by, all alone.

1969
01:57:06,859 --> 01:57:13,567
Later, Guruvaʼs corpse is
found in the Kola premises.

1970
01:57:14,692 --> 01:57:20,192
After which, the Landlord came
home to see Guruva's body.

1971
01:57:21,775 --> 01:57:25,692
The mystery too seems to
be passing over our head.

1972
01:57:27,817 --> 01:57:29,692
Take out the weapons!
- What's wrong with you?

1973
01:57:30,567 --> 01:57:31,567
Time to finish Shiva.

1974
01:57:33,234 --> 01:57:35,109
Letʼs at least ask Landlord.

1975
01:57:35,109 --> 01:57:37,234
By the time we do that,
Shiva will finish us off!!

1976
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:39,650
Didnʼt you say that we shall
bite when the time comes?

1977
01:57:39,692 --> 01:57:40,692
The time has come.

1978
01:57:44,109 --> 01:57:47,192
Mohan, I only said that we'll bite.
Not kill.

1979
01:57:47,192 --> 01:57:48,192
Ay, let's go.

1980
01:58:04,192 --> 01:58:07,400
Mahadevanna, you have some customers
who want their swords sharpened.

1981
01:58:07,442 --> 01:58:08,442
Who is that?

1982
01:58:09,025 --> 01:58:10,609
That ember doesn't
burn in the dark.

1983
01:58:10,734 --> 01:58:12,109
Only this stuff will burn bright.

1984
01:58:12,109 --> 01:58:13,234
Come tomorrow.

1985
01:58:14,359 --> 01:58:16,025
But I see embers here.

1986
01:58:17,609 --> 01:58:20,525
Please come.
My sword is being sharpened too.

1987
01:58:20,692 --> 01:58:22,734
This oldie is past his prime.

1988
01:58:22,900 --> 01:58:24,442
Let me fire it up for you.

1989
01:59:02,234 --> 01:59:04,025
Donʼt fight in here.

1990
01:59:25,609 --> 01:59:27,609
There goes my workshop.

1991
01:59:28,942 --> 01:59:30,317
Iʼll get you wood
for the repairs.

1992
02:00:00,650 --> 02:00:01,692
Shiva!

1993
02:00:20,859 --> 02:00:22,067
Come to me pricks!

1994
02:00:34,609 --> 02:00:36,900
You mongrel!

1995
02:01:01,900 --> 02:01:03,859
Start the jeep!
Get in! Letʼs go.

1996
02:01:06,817 --> 02:01:08,692
You guys never listen to me!

1997
02:01:08,692 --> 02:01:09,984
Keep moving!

1998
02:01:23,484 --> 02:01:27,942
The Landlord is taking Guruva
and is passing by in his jeep.

1999
02:01:28,109 --> 02:01:31,484
They came in a jeep and threw
the corpse in the Kola premises.

2000
02:01:31,859 --> 02:01:35,400
Later, Guruvaʼs corpse is
found in the Kola premises.

2001
02:01:35,442 --> 02:01:36,942
[GURUVA WAILING]

2002
02:01:37,109 --> 02:01:39,317
Do you know who killed Guruva?

2003
02:01:39,317 --> 02:01:40,317
You!

2004
02:02:00,025 --> 02:02:02,400
Ammakka, hasn't the child slept yet?
- No.

2005
02:02:08,067 --> 02:02:09,942
Whatʼs up Shiva?
Youʼre soaking wet.

2006
02:02:11,025 --> 02:02:12,400
I'm not just wet, Landlord.

2007
02:02:12,900 --> 02:02:13,984
Iʼve been cleansed.

2008
02:02:15,942 --> 02:02:18,150
Wow! Looks like the squatters
have a lot to feast on.

2009
02:02:18,650 --> 02:02:20,400
Now that you're squatting in here too.

2010
02:02:21,025 --> 02:02:22,025
Join me.

2011
02:02:22,067 --> 02:02:23,650
Well, you walked into my house.

2012
02:02:23,859 --> 02:02:24,859
Why canʼt I?

2013
02:02:25,650 --> 02:02:27,359
Times have changed Landlord.
I can come.

2014
02:02:28,484 --> 02:02:30,400
Looks like you're here
to settle scores, right?

2015
02:02:31,984 --> 02:02:33,109
Not really!

2016
02:02:33,734 --> 02:02:35,317
We eat boiled rice and pickle.

2017
02:02:36,234 --> 02:02:37,775
Sometimes,
we can't even afford that.

2018
02:02:39,109 --> 02:02:40,692
Yet, we are satisfied
with what we have.

2019
02:02:47,442 --> 02:02:49,067
Today, Iʼm unable to
eat this fancy food.

2020
02:02:49,359 --> 02:02:50,692
It refuses to go down my throat.

2021
02:02:51,359 --> 02:02:52,734
Eat that sukka.

2022
02:02:53,025 --> 02:02:54,900
Ammakka cooked it. Itʼs tasty.

2023
02:02:54,900 --> 02:02:56,942
If one's heart is good,
everything turns out well.

2024
02:02:58,150 --> 02:02:59,817
Canʼt trust everything you say
now, can I?

2025
02:03:00,109 --> 02:03:01,484
Iʼll have to check it out myself.

2026
02:03:07,609 --> 02:03:08,609
Itʼs nice Ammakka.

2027
02:03:08,942 --> 02:03:10,984
Shiva, have some scotch.

2028
02:03:11,275 --> 02:03:12,442
Iʼve been cleansed, Landlord.

2029
02:03:13,234 --> 02:03:14,234
You have it.

2030
02:03:16,067 --> 02:03:17,692
What do you expect me to do now?

2031
02:03:17,692 --> 02:03:19,192
Havenʼt you done enough already?

2032
02:03:19,692 --> 02:03:22,025
Are you our Demigod to
give us what we want?

2033
02:03:22,900 --> 02:03:24,942
Your judgement now
lies on that land.

2034
02:03:26,067 --> 02:03:27,067
Whatʼs the time?

2035
02:03:28,359 --> 02:03:29,984
Well, looks like time
is on our side too.

2036
02:03:30,817 --> 02:03:32,025
It's twelve o' clock.

2037
02:03:34,359 --> 02:03:35,359
It's here.

2038
02:03:36,400 --> 02:03:37,400
Your time.

2039
02:03:38,359 --> 02:03:39,359
Iʼll wait for you.

2040
02:03:39,775 --> 02:03:40,775
Donʼt miss.

2041
02:03:41,484 --> 02:03:42,484
Iʼll take your leave.

2042
02:03:43,359 --> 02:03:44,400
Itʼs okay if you are late.

2043
02:03:46,359 --> 02:03:48,150
I hope you know the place.
Kaadubettu.

2044
02:03:48,567 --> 02:03:49,609
Greetings. Bye.

2045
02:05:29,734 --> 02:05:31,150
Light!

2046
02:05:32,109 --> 02:05:34,317
In light, everything is visible.

2047
02:05:35,275 --> 02:05:36,734
But this is not just light

2048
02:05:37,275 --> 02:05:38,942
It's a vision.

2049
02:05:39,650 --> 02:05:42,984
The light which will shine
on the past and the future.

2050
02:05:43,442 --> 02:05:44,692
Do you see it?

2051
02:05:48,359 --> 02:05:51,234
At least now have you people have
realised that Landlord's true colours?

2052
02:05:51,234 --> 02:05:52,317
What the hell!

2053
02:05:52,317 --> 02:05:54,734
We trusted him,
only to be brought to the streets.

2054
02:05:55,234 --> 02:05:57,025
We should have realised
the day Guruva dies.

2055
02:05:57,067 --> 02:05:58,775
When he entered our
home and shed tears.

2056
02:05:58,775 --> 02:06:01,150
Guddi tricked us into
meeting the Landlord!

2057
02:06:01,192 --> 02:06:03,734
We should take him to task!
- What meeting is this?

2058
02:06:03,775 --> 02:06:06,234
Are you not throwing us a party
for coming out of the prison?

2059
02:06:06,234 --> 02:06:08,400
The landlord is
better than you guys!

2060
02:06:08,984 --> 02:06:11,650
He threw us an amazing party!
- He is awesome!

2061
02:06:11,692 --> 02:06:13,025
What nonsense are you talking?

2062
02:06:13,067 --> 02:06:14,525
Kamala, are you high?
Why are you hitting me?

2063
02:06:14,525 --> 02:06:15,900
Why donʼt you go?

2064
02:06:17,234 --> 02:06:18,817
If I go, it'll only be
to my home town.

2065
02:06:19,484 --> 02:06:21,025
Whatʼs the use of this meeting?

2066
02:06:21,067 --> 02:06:22,692
We have lost our land anyway.

2067
02:06:23,775 --> 02:06:25,400
You can still save your land.

2068
02:06:26,484 --> 02:06:30,775
We have documents to declare
this land as reserve forest.

2069
02:06:30,942 --> 02:06:35,317
Once it is declared, both your
land and the forest will be saved.

2070
02:06:35,317 --> 02:06:37,775
If it is declared as forest,
how will it be our land to save?

2071
02:06:37,775 --> 02:06:41,692
Once the declaration happens, you
can submit a plea to the government.

2072
02:06:42,192 --> 02:06:45,567
The land will be handed over to the
registered owner from the time of the survey.

2073
02:06:45,567 --> 02:06:48,400
Our department will do the needful.

2074
02:06:48,442 --> 02:06:50,109
The landlord has done enough.

2075
02:06:50,150 --> 02:06:51,692
You please donʼt mess it up further.

2076
02:06:51,817 --> 02:06:53,025
Shut up! Scoundrel!

2077
02:06:53,984 --> 02:06:55,317
We need to stand with him.

2078
02:06:55,984 --> 02:06:58,275
We will. But what about Shiva?

2079
02:06:58,609 --> 02:07:00,442
He must be drinking at
the Landlord's house.

2080
02:07:01,525 --> 02:07:03,192
Looks like everyone
has united against us.

2081
02:07:05,275 --> 02:07:07,275
Seems like our good times
have come to an end.

2082
02:07:08,817 --> 02:07:10,692
Let me show you the reality.

2083
02:07:10,817 --> 02:07:11,984
Gather our men.

2084
02:07:13,150 --> 02:07:14,609
Who is he to decide my fate?

2085
02:07:14,984 --> 02:07:16,275
Iʼll decide his.

2086
02:07:18,442 --> 02:07:20,650
Has the house been
cleansed yet?!

2087
02:07:35,150 --> 02:07:36,442
Are you done yet?

2088
02:07:36,442 --> 02:07:38,984
Your moron landlord has
cheated us of our land!

2089
02:07:39,025 --> 02:07:40,609
It seems he listens to you.

2090
02:07:40,650 --> 02:07:44,150
Speak to him and
set things right!

2091
02:07:46,067 --> 02:07:48,109
We're talking to you.

2092
02:07:48,109 --> 02:07:49,817
Why are you acting like
you don't hear us?!

2093
02:07:50,192 --> 02:07:52,234
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

2094
02:07:52,567 --> 02:07:54,734
Thereʼs nothing
left here for us!

2095
02:07:55,359 --> 02:07:58,525
The landlord has taken
over our lands completely!

2096
02:08:01,234 --> 02:08:02,692
He didn't just take the land.

2097
02:08:03,359 --> 02:08:04,775
He took Guruva too.

2098
02:08:05,442 --> 02:08:07,192
Grab everything you
can get your hands on!

2099
02:08:07,192 --> 02:08:08,942
I will take care
of that scoundrel!

2100
02:08:14,234 --> 02:08:15,400
Why the hell are you quiet?!

2101
02:08:15,442 --> 02:08:16,442
Whatʼs wrong with you?!

2102
02:08:16,484 --> 02:08:18,692
Letʼs barge into his house and butcher him!
Come on now!

2103
02:08:21,442 --> 02:08:22,609
Nobody is going anywhere.

2104
02:08:34,859 --> 02:08:37,984
Shiva, whatʼs on your mind?

2105
02:08:49,650 --> 02:08:51,317
Let bygones be bygones.

2106
02:08:51,984 --> 02:08:52,984
I'm sorry.

2107
02:08:53,984 --> 02:08:58,817
My father always told me to pay heed to the stone in
the forest, through which the Demigod will speak.

2108
02:09:01,192 --> 02:09:02,359
I listened to it.

2109
02:09:02,609 --> 02:09:03,859
The forest spoke.

2110
02:09:06,317 --> 02:09:09,025
Maybe if I lend my ear,
I might hear the Demigod speak too.

2111
02:09:10,650 --> 02:09:14,692
Our beliefs may differ Shiva,
but we are part of the same existence.

2112
02:09:15,984 --> 02:09:18,109
If something befalls me,
will you fight for my people?

2113
02:09:28,942 --> 02:09:29,942
I think heʼs here.

2114
02:09:30,859 --> 02:09:38,859
[INDISTINCT CRIES]

2115
02:10:04,942 --> 02:10:06,234
The officer is here too.

2116
02:10:06,650 --> 02:10:10,192
Shiva!
Iʼm glad you called me here.

2117
02:10:10,692 --> 02:10:12,442
Iʼm sure everyone is
aware of the matter.

2118
02:10:12,442 --> 02:10:13,817
Thereʼs nothing left to discuss.

2119
02:10:13,817 --> 02:10:14,984
How about this?

2120
02:10:15,025 --> 02:10:18,150
Take that stone from my
land and leave this village.

2121
02:10:18,192 --> 02:10:20,359
Who the hell are you to
ask us to leave our land?!

2122
02:10:20,400 --> 02:10:22,025
I think youʼve
forgotten who I am.

2123
02:10:22,025 --> 02:10:24,400
What have you done for us
to remember you any way?

2124
02:10:24,400 --> 02:10:25,442
Of course he has.

2125
02:10:25,484 --> 02:10:27,775
He cheated us of our land.
Killed my son.

2126
02:10:27,775 --> 02:10:29,609
Cheated us and
snatched everything...

2127
02:10:29,609 --> 02:10:31,150
Shut the f**k up,
you illiterates!!

2128
02:10:31,609 --> 02:10:35,484
If you can be this arrogant on charity
land, imagine how cocky I can get!

2129
02:10:35,650 --> 02:10:38,525
Is the Forest officer's presence
giving you this newfound courage?

2130
02:10:38,567 --> 02:10:41,567
I donʼt understand what is giving
you all this courage to blabber.

2131
02:10:41,609 --> 02:10:43,984
It is said that the lamp burns
its brightest before it dies.

2132
02:10:44,275 --> 02:10:45,942
I feel the same when I see you.

2133
02:10:47,359 --> 02:10:48,359
Kumara!

2134
02:10:48,984 --> 02:10:50,609
Have you all gone deaf?!

2135
02:10:50,984 --> 02:10:52,525
Heʼs speaking about
fire burning bright.

2136
02:10:53,150 --> 02:10:54,609
Go ahead! Burn it for him.

2137
02:10:54,984 --> 02:10:56,192
Burn them all!

2138
02:11:29,192 --> 02:11:30,609
Thrash those dogs!

2139
02:13:59,525 --> 02:14:01,442
Rampanna! Did the bullet
actually bounce back?!

2140
02:14:01,484 --> 02:14:02,692
My Grandpa's gun after all!

2141
02:14:05,234 --> 02:14:06,609
Heʼs one of us, Landlord.

2142
02:14:06,650 --> 02:14:08,317
Who cares!

2143
02:14:11,400 --> 02:14:12,942
I'll teach these
imbeciles a lesson.

2144
02:14:12,984 --> 02:14:15,317
Thinks they can come
to our home and...

2145
02:14:16,025 --> 02:14:18,067
Salaam Alaikum!
- Valaikum Salaam!

2146
02:14:21,234 --> 02:14:22,234
Ya Allah!

2147
02:14:32,525 --> 02:14:33,525
Landlord, thatʼs a child.

2148
02:14:33,984 --> 02:14:34,984
Is it yours?

2149
02:14:36,775 --> 02:14:39,609
If it survives, tomorrow the child
too will claim its share of land.

2150
02:15:43,067 --> 02:15:44,317
Take sir away to safety!

2151
02:16:09,942 --> 02:16:11,109
Bulla!

2152
02:16:21,859 --> 02:16:23,400
Bulla!

2153
02:17:27,525 --> 02:17:29,192
Bulla!

2154
02:17:45,234 --> 02:17:46,234
Die.

2155
02:18:00,859 --> 02:18:02,900
Throw that mongrel over here.

2156
02:18:04,775 --> 02:18:06,609
Koragappa! Rajeeva!

2157
02:18:07,192 --> 02:18:09,609
How much more you plan to fight?

2158
02:18:16,817 --> 02:18:17,817
Step aside.

2159
02:18:17,859 --> 02:18:18,859
Hold this.

2160
02:18:19,984 --> 02:18:20,984
Bulla!

2161
02:18:21,025 --> 02:18:22,025
Aye!

2162
02:18:23,150 --> 02:18:24,525
Come back guys.
Thatʼs enough.

2163
02:18:24,525 --> 02:18:25,775
Everything's done.

2164
02:18:25,817 --> 02:18:26,859
Shiva is dead.

2165
02:18:26,859 --> 02:18:27,859
Shiva!

2166
02:18:28,067 --> 02:18:29,067
Shiva.

2167
02:18:29,109 --> 02:18:30,234
Shiva.

2168
02:18:31,192 --> 02:18:33,692
My son! What happened?!

2169
02:18:36,942 --> 02:18:38,484
Are all of your family members here?

2170
02:18:38,525 --> 02:18:40,359
Only a handful of you made
it, huh?

2171
02:18:41,400 --> 02:18:46,275
You canʼt fool me with that useless
stone the way you fooled my ancestors.

2172
02:18:48,317 --> 02:18:50,025
You have two options now.

2173
02:18:50,942 --> 02:18:53,317
Either let go of this land
or let go of your life.

2174
02:18:54,525 --> 02:18:56,734
Widows donʼt have to worry.

2175
02:18:57,400 --> 02:18:58,609
Iʼm here for you.

2176
02:19:00,025 --> 02:19:02,109
Kamala, what say?!

2177
02:19:04,942 --> 02:19:08,525
Remember, I'll be accompanied by my
Compatriot spirit, the ferocious Guliga.

2178
02:19:09,484 --> 02:19:15,400
Should you err, even if I forgive
you, Guliga won't.

2179
02:19:46,192 --> 02:19:49,734
PROTECT US LORD GULIGA!
[IN UNISON]

2180
02:20:35,234 --> 02:20:36,234
Go.

2181
02:21:18,984 --> 02:21:19,984
Lord.

2182
02:22:44,359 --> 02:22:47,275
On the land of Swami Varahamurthy,
before committing any atrocities...

2183
02:22:47,484 --> 02:22:50,900
The one who lost the right to teach
them a lesson, on this holy land...

2184
02:22:51,234 --> 02:22:53,442
Did you forget the guide, Kshetrapala?

2185
02:22:54,817 --> 02:22:56,984
My lord Panjurli might have
forgiven, but I will not.

2186
02:22:56,984 --> 02:22:58,650
The result of your deeds...

2187
02:22:58,859 --> 02:23:02,567
By offering your
blood to this soil.

2188
02:23:03,025 --> 02:23:05,400
I shall safeguard its righteousness.
